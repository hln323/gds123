        "text": "Authorities in Turkey have arrested dozens of people for \"provocative\" social media posts after the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu was detained on Wednesday.\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people held on charges including corruption and aiding terrorist groups - a move that has sparked protests in Istanbul and the capital Ankara.\nA member of the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), Imamoglu is a key rival of President President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and was set to be named as a presidential candidate for the 2028 elections later this week.\nCritics say his arrest is a \"coup\" and are planning further demonstrations, despite Istanbul's pro-Erdogan governor banning protests for four days.\nInterior minister Ali Yerlikaya announced on Thursday morning that police had identified 261 \"suspect account managers\" online who had allegedly posted content \"inciting the public to hatred and hostility\" and \"incitement to commit a crime\".\n\"Thirty-seven suspects were caught and efforts are continuing to catch the other suspects,\" he said, adding that more than 18.6 million posts appeared online about Wednesday's arrests by 0600 local time (0300 GMT) on Thursday.\nImamoglu may have spent his first night in detention but the municipality is still controlled by his opposition party - for now.\nAs commuters boarded trains at metro stations across the city, a recording of one of Imamoglu's previous public speeches blared out from loudspeakers: \"I promise you with my honour that I am going to win this fight.\"\nUniversity students who have only ever known the rule of Erdogan marched on the streets in the pouring rain chanting, \"We are not scared, we won't be silenced, we will not obey\" - a common opposition slogan in Turkey.\nHowever, numbers of protesters are still relatively small for a city with more than 16 million people. For now, they are unlikely to raise political pressure on Erdogan to release Imamoglu.\nThe office of the detained mayor has called for protesters to gather for a second night in a row outside the municipal hall.\nCHP leader Ozgur Ozel addressed supporters at one rally on Wednesday night and called on them to \"fill the streets\".\nPolice clashed with demonstrators in several places, firing tear gas and pepper spray.\nTurkish authorities have also restricted social media usage nationwide after Wednesday's arrests, including the use of WhatsApp, according to UK-based internet watchdog Netblocks.\nDozens of police officers were involved in the raid on Imamoglu's house in Istanbul early on Wednesday morning.\nHe was one of 106 people detained in the operation.\nThe arrests come as part of a major nationwide crackdown in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, municipalities, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.\nSome fear more opposition figures will be brought in for questioning over the coming weeks as part of a campaign of intimidation.\nLocal prosecutors also announced on Thursday they had seized a construction company owned by the Istanbul mayor, as part of a investigation into alleged financial crimes.\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the justice ministry on Wednesday criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on their judicial independence.\nLast year, Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara.\nIt was the first time since President Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\nThe elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power.\nErdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey. Due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028, unless he changes the constitution.\nThe CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which 1.5 million members will vote and Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.\nCHP leader Ozel has said they will vote for Imamoglu regardless of where he is.\nThe party has also called on citizens to vote in a symbolic election, with plans to place ballot boxes in districts all over Turkey for members of the public to show their support for the detained mayor.",

        "text": "In a poor neighbourhood of the Venezuelan city of Maracay, the mother of 24-year-old Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Casique was waiting for him on Saturday.\nIt had been 18 months since he had migrated to the US to begin a new life but he had told her that he was now being deported back to Caracas, Venezuela's capital, for being in the US illegally. They had spoken that morning, just before he was due to depart.\n\"I thought it was a good sign that he was being deported [to Caracas],\" Myrelis Casique L\u00f3pez recalled. She wanted him home.\nBut he never arrived. And while watching a television news report on Sunday, Ms Casique was shocked to see her son, not in the US or Venezuela but 1,430 miles (2,300km) away in El Salvador.\nThe footage showed 238 Venezuelans sent by US authorities to the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot, a notorious mega-jail. She saw men with shaved heads and shackles on their hands and feet, being forcefully escorted by heavily-armed security forces.\nThe Trump administration says all of the deportees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which has found itself in the White House's crosshairs. The powerful multi-national crime group, which Trump recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation, has been accused of sex trafficking, drug smuggling and murders both at home and in major US cities.\nMs Casique told the BBC she was certain her son was among the detainees, even if no official list of names has been released.\n\"It's him. It's him,\" she said, gesturing at a picture in which a man is seated, with his head bowed, on a prison floor alongside a row of others, a tattoo visible on his arm. \"I recognize his features.\"\nShe also maintains that he is innocent.\nUS immigration officials have said the detainees were \"carefully vetted\" and verified as gang members before being flown to El Salvador. They said they used evidence collected during surveillance, police encounters or testimonies from victims to vet them.\n\"Our job is to send the terrorists out before anyone else gets raped or murdered,\" Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Wednesday.\nMany of the deportees do not have US criminal records, however, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official acknowledged in court documents. And they were deported under a law last invoked during wartime that doesn\u2019t require them to be charged with a crime.\nThose who do have criminal records include migrants with arrests on charges ranging from murder, fentanyl trafficking and kidnapping to home invasion and operating a gang-run brothel, according to the Trump administration.\nIn Mr Garc\u00eda's case, his mother disputes that her son was involved in criminal activity. He left Venezuela in 2019, first to Peru, seeking new opportunities as overlapping economic, political and social crises engulfed the country, she said. He crossed illegally into the US in September 2023.\nHis mother has not seen him in person in six years.\n\"He doesn't belong to any criminal gang, either in the US or in Venezuela\u2026 he's not a criminal,\" Ms Casique said. \"What he's been is a barber.\"\n\"Unfortunately, he has tattoos,\" she added, convinced that the roses and names of family members that adorn his body led to his detention and deportation. That is how she, and other family members, recognised him from pictures released of the deportees in El Salvador.\nSeveral other families have said they believe that deportees were mistakenly identified as Tren de Aragua gang members because of their tattoos.\n\"It's him,\" Ms Casique said tearfully in Maracay, referencing the image from the prison. \"I wish it wasn't him\u2026 he didn't deserve to be transferred there.\"\nThe mother of Mervin Yamarte, 29, also identified her son in the video.\n\"I threw myself on the floor, saying that God couldn't do this to my son,\" she told the BBC from her home in the Los Pescadores neighbourhood of Maracaibo, Venezuela.\nLike Ms Casique, she denies her son was involved with the brutal gang. He had left his hometown and travelled to the US through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, crossing illegally in 2023 with three of his friends: Edwar Herrera, 23; Andy Javier Perozo, 30; and Ringo Rinc\u00f3n, 39.\nThe BBC spoke with their families and friends, who said they had spotted the four men in the footage from the El Salvador jail.\nMr Yamarte's mother said her son had worked in a tortilla factory, sometimes working 12-hour shifts. On Sundays, he played football with his friends, who all shared a home in Dallas, Texas.\n\"He's a good, noble young man. There's a mistake,\" she said.\nPresident Trump invoked a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the men without due process in the US, saying they were Tren de Aragua gang members.\nDespite the US government's assurances that the deportees were carefully vetted, the move has had a chilling effect on many Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans in the US, who fear that Trump's use of the law could lead to more Venezuelans being accused and swiftly deported without any charges or convictions.\n\"Of course we're afraid. We're terrified,\" said Adelys Ferro, the executive-director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, an advocacy group. \"We want every single member of TdA to pay for their crimes. But we don't know what the criteria is.\"\n\"They [Venezeulans] are living in uncertain times,\" she said. \"They don't know what decisions to make - even people with documents and have been here for years.\"\nMs Ferro's concerns were echoed by Brian de la Vega, a prominent Florida-based, Venezuela-born immigration lawyer and military veteran.\nMany of his clients are in the Miami area, including Doral - a suburb sometimes given the moniker \"Doralzuela\" for its large Venezuelan population.\n\"The majority of Venezuelans in the US are trying to do the right thing. They fear going back to their home country,\" Mr de la Vega told the BBC. \"The main concern, for me, is how they're identifying these members. The standard is very low.\"\nMany Venezuelan expatriates in the US - particularly South Florida - have been broadly supportive of Trump, who has taken a tough stance on the left-wing government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro which many of them fled.\nBut in February, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status - TPS - for Venezuelans, which had shielded many from deportation. The programme officially ends on 7 April and could impact nearly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the US.\n\"Trump's speeches have always been strong about the Venezuelan regime, especially during the campaign,\" Mr de la Vega said. \"I don't think people expected all this.\"\nDaniel Campo, a Venezuelan-born naturalised US citizen in Pennsylvania - and ardent Trump supporter - told the BBC that while he remains steadfast in his support of the president, he has some concerns about the deportations to El Salvador and the end of TPS.\n\"I certainly hope that when they are doing raids to deport Tren de Aragua, especially to the prison in El Salvador, they are being extra careful,\" he said.\nAmong those caught by surprise by the end of TPS and the recent deportations is a 25-year-old Venezuelan man who asked to be identified only as Yilber, who arrived in the US in 2022 after a long, dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico.\nHe's now in the US - but unsure about what comes next.\n\"I left Venezuela because of the repression, and the insecurity. My neighbourhood in Caracas had gangs,\" he said. \"Now I don't know what's going to happen here.\"",

        "text": "A jury in the trial of a former nurse accused of murdering a woman on a remote Australian beach has been discharged, after they could not reach a verdict.\nToyah Cordingley was stabbed at least 26 times while out walking her dog in October 2018.\nThe 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father, half-buried in sand dunes on Wangetti beach between the popular tourist hotspots of Cairns and Port Douglas.\nRajwinder Singh, 40, who travelled to India the day after Ms Cordingley's body was found, was charged with murder. He was arrested and then extradited to Australia in 2023.\nBut jurors at Cairns Supreme Court said they were deadlocked, and unable to reach a unanimous decision on his guilt after two-and-half days of deliberations. The judge thanked the jury for their \"diligence\".\nUnder Queensland law, jury verdicts in murder cases must be unanimous. So Mr Singh will face another trial.\nOriginally from Buttar Kalan in the Indian state of Punjab, Mr Singh had been living in Innisfail at the time of the killing, a town about two hours south from the crime scene.\nProsecutors said they did not have a motive for the killing of Ms Cordingley - a health store worker and animal shelter volunteer - and there was no evidence of a sexual assault.\nThe trial at Cairns Supreme court heard that DNA highly likely to be Mr Singh's was discovered on a stick in the victim's grave.\nData from mobile phone towers also suggested Ms Cordingley's phone had moved in a similar pattern to Mr Singh's blue Alfa Romeo car on the day the victim went missing.\nThe prosecution also suggested the hurried way Mr Singh left Australia without saying goodbye to his family or colleagues pointed to his guilt.\nMr Singh had denied murder \u2013 and had told an undercover police officer he had seen the killing, then left the country, leaving behind his wife and children because he feared for his own life.\nHis defence lawyer said he was \"a coward\" but not a killer, and accused police of a \"flawed\" investigation that did not look sufficiently at other possible suspects.\nThey said DNA found at the scene, including on the victim's discarded selfie stick, did not match Mr Singh's profile.\n\"There is an unknown person's DNA at that grave site,\" defence barrister Angus Edwards told the jury.",

        "text": "Dozens of bus passengers in Ethiopia have been abducted by armed men in the country's largest region, Oromia, as they were were travelling from the capital, Addis Ababa.\nDetails are only just emerging of the kidnappings which took place earlier this week.\nThe incident happened in Ali Doro, which is near an area where around 100 university students were similarly abducted as they were heading home from their campus last July.\nSurvivors and local authorities blamed those abductions on the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group that operates in the area. The group denied involvement at the time.\nReferring to this week's incident, the OLA has said it had received reports of the abductions and that it was \"conducting an investigation\".\nAccording to one report by a local media organisation, the passengers were heading to Debre Markos, a town in the country's Amhara region, when they were attacked by the armed men who exchanged fire with local security forces.\nAnother report said several buses were attacked during which at least one person died. The number of abductees could be as high as 50, according to this report.\nThe government has not yet said anything about the kidnappings and the BBC's attempts to get an official response have not been successful.\nAbductions of civilians - including passengers - have become increasingly common in the area. Armed groups here have in the past demanded ransoms for the release of people they hold.\nThe OLA says it is fighting for the self-determination of Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo.\nIt has been classified as a terrorist organisation by the federal parliament and operates in various areas in Oromia including the district where Ali Doro is located.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "text": "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.\nData leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.\nThe BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.\nEcopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.\nThe company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.\nThe huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.\nMembers of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.\nThe wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.\nWhen the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.\nOne local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.\nIn places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.\nA fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.\nPointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"\nEcopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.\nIn response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.\nAndr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.\nHe joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".\nMr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"\nHe left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.\nOne database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.\nEcopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.\nMr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".\n\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.\nThe BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.\nEcopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.\n\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.\nMr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.\nColombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.\nHe also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.\nHowever, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.\nFigures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.\nAsked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".\nThe firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.\nIt says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.\nThe data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.\nThe fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.\nShe said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.\nIt is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.\nA 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.\nMr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.\n\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.\nMr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.\nShe said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.\nThe fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.\nAsked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.\nExperts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.\nDespite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.\nMatthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.\nBut he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.\nPrivate security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.\nMr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.\n\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.\nHe says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".\nMr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.\nEcopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.\nThe BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.\nNow living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.\nHe has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.\n\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.\nMr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.\n\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"\nAnd Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.\n\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026 And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

        "text": "At least 85 Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli air strikes in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.\nHours later Israel's military said it intercepted three rockets which Hamas's armed wing said it fired at Tel Aviv in response.\nIt comes after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the territory this week, with air strikes having already killed more than 430 people over the past two days, according to the health ministry.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday it had started a ground operation in northern Gaza. There had been a lull in large-scale military action since January when a ceasefire began.\nIsrael resumed attacks on Tuesday as talks to extend the deal failed to progress, warning they would intensify until Hamas released the remaining hostages.\nIsrael says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\nIDF spokesperson Col Avichay Adraee said Hamas had fired three rockets from southern Gaza. One was intercepted, while the other two fell in an \"open area\", he added in a post on X.\nThe Israeli military said earlier on Thursday it had begun \"targeted ground activities\" to create what it called a \"partial buffer between the north and south\" in Gaza. It called the action a \"limited ground operation\".\nCol Adraee said forces were deployed up to the centre of a strip known as the Netzarim Corridor which divides northern and southern Gaza.\nMeanwhile, five staff members of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa were among those killed over the \"past few days\", the agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.\n\"They were teachers, doctors and nurses,\" he added, warning that \"the worst is yet to come\" amid the ongoing ground invasion.\nOn Wednesday the UN said that one of its workers had been killed and five others injured after its compound in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza was damaged. It said the circumstances of the incident were unclear.\nGaza's health ministry blamed an Israeli strike, while Israel's military said it did not attack the compound.\nElsewhere, Yemen's Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile at Israel on Thursday, aiming for Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, the Iran-backed group's military spokesperson said.\nNo injuries were reported and the IDF said the missile was stopped before entering Israel.\nOn Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had \"resumed combat in full force\" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place \"under fire\".\nIsrael and Hamas have failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, which expired on 1 March.\nHamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to keep the ceasefire going.\nIsrael blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though without providing evidence.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage. Twenty-five Israeli and five Thai hostages were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.\nIsrael responded to the October attack with a massive military offensive, which had killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, mainly civilians, before Israel resumed its campaign, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel's offensive has also caused huge amounts of destruction to homes and infrastructure.",

        "text": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.\nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.\nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.\nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.\nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, but research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013 although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "text": "After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth.\nTheir SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida.\nA pod of dolphins circled the craft.\nAfter a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\"The crew's doing great,\" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference.\nIt brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days.\nIt was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems.\n\"It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate.\nThanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a \"great partner\".\nThe journey home took 17 hours.\nThe astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment.\nThey will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families.\n\"The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,\" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut.\n\"All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time.\"\nThe saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.\nThey were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.\nBut the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.\nStarliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.\nSo Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.\nIt flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.\nThe only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.\nThe Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.\nThey carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.\nAnd despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.\nThroughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.\nNow the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.\nLong-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.\nIt can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity.\nBritish astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust.\n\"Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.\n\"But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"\nIn interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home.\nSpeaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice - to be back on Earth and feel Earth.\"",

        "text": "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.\nA team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.\nBut a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.\nIn a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".\nSouth Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.\nThe ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.\nIn a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.\nIt said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.\nThe statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".\n\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.\nThe department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.\nThe department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".\nThe alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.\nThe Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.\nThe base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.\nSouth African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.\nThese expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.\nBut on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".\nA South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".\nIncidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.\nPsychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.\n\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.\n\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.\nGabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.\n\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.\n\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.\nSources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.\nBut any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.\nAdditional reporting by Ed Habershon and Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "text": "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.\nThis is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.\nThat pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.\nOf the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nManufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\nSUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.\nEnvironmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.\nExperts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.\nMomentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.\nAnd in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.\nIts sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"\nChina saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.\nIndustry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.\n\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nAutomobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.\n\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.\n\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.\nBecause of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.\n\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.\nThe agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.\nIn fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.\nBut industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\n\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.\n\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"\nAlthough the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.\nAs for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.\nSimilar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.\nOverall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.\n\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.\nThe UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country.",
