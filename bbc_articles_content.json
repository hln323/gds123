        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin would breach a peace deal with Ukraine if it is not defended, Sir Keir Starmer has said, after attending a meeting of senior military leaders in London.\nThe UK prime minister said any agreement to stop the fighting between Russia and Ukraine would \"only be lasting\" if there were \"security arrangements in place\".\nHe was speaking at Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood, London, where more than 20 countries gathered at a closed meeting to discuss proposals for troops in Ukraine to help guarantee the country's security as part of any peace deal.\nSir Keir said security arrangements would make clear to Russia there would be \"severe consequences if they are to breach any deal\".\nThe prime minister said the UK and its allies were moving from \"political momentum\" to \"military planning\", which he said had \"to be done now\" before a deal was agreed.\nHe said: \"It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.\n\"We know that because it happened before. I'm absolutely clear in my mind it will happen again\".\nSir Keir ruled out redeploying UK troops from countries such as Estonia to commit to Kyiv, saying: \"There's no pulling back from our commitments to other countries.\"\nUK Defence Secretary John Healey was at the closed meeting of military leaders from countries that form part of what Sir Keir has dubbed the \"coalition of the willing\".\nDowning Street said the military leaders would be involved in \"granular planning\" for details of any potential deployment.\nThe UK called the meeting of military chiefs after a summit earlier this month attended by 26 countries.\nThe potential deployment of troops should be described as a \"reassurance force\" rather than a \"peacekeeping force\", defence and diplomatic sources say.\nEarlier, Sir Keir visited the Port of Barrow, in Cumbria, north-west England where the UK's nuclear submarines are built.\nHe told reporters the talks in London were focussing on how to \"keep the skies, and the seas, and the borders safe in Ukraine\".\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, sending British Typhoon jets to Ukraine to provide air cover for troops was one of the proposals discussed during the meeting.\nAhead of the talks, Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard said \"we're not yet talking about numbers\" of UK troops potentially being sent to Ukraine \"because we're still designing the shape of the force\".\nGiving an example, he said: \"If one nation offers fast jet combat air, like a Typhoon aircraft for instance, how will the other nations work alongside it? Where will it refuel? How will it operate with other nations' capabilities?\"\nThe armed forces minister said he expected discussions would be to ensure \"any force in or around Ukraine can be as credible as possible\".\nDuring a visit to Norway on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia \"must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war\".\nCalls between US President Donald Trump, Putin and Zelensky, have failed to produce the 30-day ceasefire envisaged by the White House.\nOn Thursday Zelensky said Ukrainian officials would meet their US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next Monday, after the Kremlin confirmed US-Russia talks there the same day.\nThe latest talks come as the US attempts to broker a ceasefire between the two nations after more than three years of fighting.\nBoth Zelensky and Putin have agreed to a ceasefire in principle during conversations with the US - but one has yet to materialise due to conflicting conditions.",

        "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukrainian and US officials will meet for peace talks in Saudi Arabia next Monday, after the Kremlin confirmed US-Russia talks there the same day.\nUkraine's leader said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war\". Moscow's demands include a complete end to military assistance for Ukraine.\nZelensky also warned that taking Nato membership for Ukraine off the table - something Putin has said was non-negotiable for peace - would be a \"big gift to Russia\".\nHe also rebuffed claims by the White House that he discussed ceding ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants to the US during a call with President Donald Trump.\nThe latest talks come as the US attempts to broker a ceasefire between the two nations after more than three years of fighting.\nBoth Zelensky and Putin have agreed to a ceasefire in principle during conversations with the US - but one has yet to materialise due to conflicting conditions.\nThe Russian leader most recently agreed to a halt to air strikes on energy infrastructure - but such strikes from both sides have continued.\nZelensky said a Ukrainian delegation would hand the US a list of infrastructure facilities it wants to be protected from Russian strikes at Monday's talks.\nAsked about the White House touting the possible US ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants at a joint news conference with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re in Oslo, Zelensky ruled this out entirely.\nHe said that the two had discussed the Zaporizhia power plant - which is currently under Russian control - in his phone call with Trump, but stressed that \"all nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine\".\nHowever, he said he was open to the US taking the plant from Russia to invest in or modernise.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio had earlier said that US ownership \"would be the best protection for that infrastructure\".\nAsked if he was ready to make territorial concessions to Russia, particularly Crimea, which has been in Russian hands since 2014, Zelensky said: \"That is a Ukrainian peninsula,\" adding that Crimea was an \"integral part\" of his country.\nCrimea is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, despite Russia's occupation and claimed annexation.\nWhen asked what a ceasefire might look like, Zelensky said the first stage would have to be a ceasefire by land and sea, as Ukraine sees this as the only way to stop Russian aggression.\nTrump was able to extract an agreement for a ceasefire on energy infrastructure - which Russia has repeatedly targeted - from Putin in a call on Tuesday, but nothing more.\nRussia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said earlier this week that Moscow will seek guarantees that Nato would exclude Ukraine from membership and that Ukraine would remain neutral in any peace deal.\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining the military alliance, saying it was \"not a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement\".\nIn the meantime, the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 - continues. Strikes overnight killed two people in Ukraine, while Ukrainian drone attacks injured 10 and set an airfield on fire in Russia.\nSpeaking to EU leaders via video link at a meeting in Brussels, Zelensky reiterated calls for military aid to continue, asking European leaders for at least \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.18bn) for artillery shells \"as soon as possible\", and said that continued support for Ukraine was \"crucial\".\nHe also said the EU must be involved in peace talks, and urged Europe not to \"ease pressure on Russia over the war\".\nAfter Trump and Zelensky engaged in a public shouting match in the Oval Office over the war, the White House announced a pause to military aid for Ukraine.\nThe pause from Ukraine's main military backer was lifted a few days later after talks between the US and Ukraine, which also saw the backing of the proposed 30-day ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that any peace deal would \"only be lasting\" if there were \"security arrangements in place\", after proposing a \"coalition of the willing\" to enforce peace in Ukraine following a deal.\nHis comments came during a visit to a military base in London, after holding a closed-door meeting with senior military officers of more than 20 countries involved in plans for the coalition.\nSir Keir said the UK and its allies were moving from \"political momentum\" to \"military planning\", which he said had \"to be done now\" before a deal was agreed.\nHe said: \"It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.\n\"We know that because it happened before. I'm absolutely clear in my mind it will happen again.\"",

        "text": "A jury in the trial of a former nurse accused of murdering a woman on a remote Australian beach has been discharged, after they could not reach a verdict.\nToyah Cordingley was stabbed at least 26 times while out walking her dog in October 2018.\nThe 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father, half-buried in sand dunes on Wangetti beach between the popular tourist hotspots of Cairns and Port Douglas.\nRajwinder Singh, 40, who travelled to India the day after Ms Cordingley's body was found, was charged with murder. He was arrested and then extradited to Australia in 2023.\nBut jurors at Cairns Supreme Court said they were deadlocked, and unable to reach a unanimous decision on his guilt after two-and-half days of deliberations. The judge thanked the jury for their \"diligence\".\nUnder Queensland law, jury verdicts in murder cases must be unanimous. So Mr Singh will face another trial.\nOriginally from Buttar Kalan in the Indian state of Punjab, Mr Singh had been living in Innisfail at the time of the killing, a town about two hours south from the crime scene.\nProsecutors said they did not have a motive for the killing of Ms Cordingley - a health store worker and animal shelter volunteer - and there was no evidence of a sexual assault.\nThe trial at Cairns Supreme court heard that DNA highly likely to be Mr Singh's was discovered on a stick in the victim's grave.\nData from mobile phone towers also suggested Ms Cordingley's phone had moved in a similar pattern to Mr Singh's blue Alfa Romeo car on the day the victim went missing.\nThe prosecution also suggested the hurried way Mr Singh left Australia without saying goodbye to his family or colleagues pointed to his guilt.\nMr Singh had denied murder \u2013 and had told an undercover police officer he had seen the killing, then left the country, leaving behind his wife and children because he feared for his own life.\nHis defence lawyer said he was \"a coward\" but not a killer, and accused police of a \"flawed\" investigation that did not look sufficiently at other possible suspects.\nThey said DNA found at the scene, including on the victim's discarded selfie stick, did not match Mr Singh's profile.\n\"There is an unknown person's DNA at that grave site,\" defence barrister Angus Edwards told the jury.",

        "text": "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.\nData leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.\nThe BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.\nEcopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.\nThe company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.\nThe huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.\nMembers of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.\nThe wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.\nWhen the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.\nOne local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.\nIn places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.\nA fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.\nPointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"\nEcopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.\nIn response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.\nAndr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.\nHe joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".\nMr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"\nHe left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.\nOne database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.\nEcopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.\nMr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".\n\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.\nThe BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.\nEcopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.\n\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.\nMr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.\nColombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.\nHe also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.\nHowever, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.\nFigures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.\nAsked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".\nThe firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.\nIt says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.\nThe data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.\nThe fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.\nShe said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.\nIt is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.\nA 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.\nMr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.\n\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.\nMr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.\nShe said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.\nThe fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.\nAsked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.\nMs Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.\nExperts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.\nDespite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.\nMatthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.\nBut he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.\nPrivate security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.\nMr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.\n\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.\nHe says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".\nMr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.\nEcopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.\nThe BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.\nNow living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.\nHe has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.\n\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.\nMr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.\n\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"\nAnd Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.\n\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026 And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

        "text": "Hamas says it launched three rockets at Tel Aviv - the first time the group is known to have fired back since Israel resumed its military offensive in Gaza.\nIsrael said it intercepted one of the missiles and the others fell into uninhabited land.\nAt least 591 people - including more than 200 children - have been killed since Israel resumed fighting on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday that it had started a ground operation in the Palestinian territory.\nThere had been a reprieve from large-scale military action since January, when a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began.\nThe IDF said late on Thursday that soldiers had begun \"conducting ground activity\" in Rafah, which lies in the south of the territory near the Egyptian border.\nIt said in a statement that troops had \"dismantled... terrorist infrastructure\", adding that IDF forces were also continuing ground activity in north and central Gaza.\nEarlier, Israel's military said it had begun \"targeted ground activities\" to create what it called a \"partial buffer between the north and south\" of Gaza. It called the action a \"limited ground operation\".\nIDF spokesperson Col Avichay Adraee said forces were deployed up to the centre of a strip, known as the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern and southern Gaza.\nIsraeli government spokesman, David Mencer, blamed Hamas for the resumption of violence, saying it had \"forced this escalation, it rejected every hostage deal, including the offers mediated by the US and others\".\nIsrael resumed attacks on Tuesday as talks to extend the ceasefire deal failed to progress, warning that they would intensify until Hamas released the remaining hostages.\nIsrael says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nMeanwhile, five staff members of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa were among those killed over the \"past few days\", the agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.\n\"They were teachers, doctors and nurses,\" he added, warning that \"the worst is yet to come\" amid the ongoing ground invasion.\nOn Wednesday, the UN said that one of its workers had been killed after its compound in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza was damaged. While it said the circumstances remain unclear, UN Office for Project Services head Jorge Moreira said it was \"not an accident\" and \"at least an incident\".\nGaza's health ministry blamed an Israeli strike, which it said injured five others. Israel's military said it did not attack the compound but was investigating the incident.\nThe US - a major weapons supplier to Israel - said that it was committed to international law regarding the supply of weapons supplies.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said US President Donald Trump \"fully supports Israel and the IDF in the actions that they've taken in recent days\".\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy confirmed on Thursday that a UK national had been wounded in the compound attack. It comes after a charity said one of its workers, a 51-year-old British bomb disposal expert, had been injured.\n\"Our priority is supporting them and their family at this time,\" he told MPs.\nAt the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Qasim Abu Sharqiya said his two-year-old son, Omar, had been born through in vitro fertilisation (IVF) after five years of trying.\n\"They bombed a tent next to us and he died,\" he told AFP. \"Omar is my only son, oh world, and I have no one else.\"\nA doctor there, Tanya Haj Hassan, told the BBC's Newshour that she had heard of at least 76 people who \"didn't even make it into the ER\" but were taken \"straight to the mortuary\".\nShe recalled \"a level of horror and evil that is really hard to articulate - it felt like Armageddon\".\nThousands of Israelis joined anti-Netanyahu protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, calling for the return of the hostages.\nSeveral arrests were made, with police in Jerusalem deploying a water cannon against demonstrators.\nElsewhere, Yemen's Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile at Israel on Thursday, aiming for Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, the Iran-backed group's military spokesperson said.\nNo injuries were reported and the IDF said the missile was stopped before entering Israel.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that it had \"resumed combat in full force\" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place \"under fire\".\nA group representing hostages' families has accused the Israeli government of choosing \"to give up the hostages\" by launching new strikes.\nIsrael and Hamas have failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, which expired on 1 March.\nHamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to prolong the ceasefire.\nIsrael blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though did not provide evidence for this claim.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage. Twenty-five Israeli and five Thai hostages were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attack with a massive military offensive, which had killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, mainly civilians, before Israel resumed its campaign, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel's offensive has also caused huge amounts of destruction to homes and infrastructure.",

        "text": "Thousands of Tesla Cybertrucks have been recalled in the US due to concerns about part of the electric car's trim falling off in the model's eighth and largest ever recall.\nThe issue affects more than 46,000 trucks made starting in November 2023, which analysts say amounts to nearly all Cybertrucks.\nIt comes as Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment, grapples with falling sales amid a backlash against the firm and its boss Elon Musk.\nOn Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three unnamed people would face charges for setting fire to Tesla cars and charging stations, accusing them of \"domestic terrorism\".\nTesla does not break out sales of the Cybertruck, but car tech firm Cox Automotive has estimated roughly 39,000 were sold in the US last year.\nPrior Cybertruck recalls involved failing windshield wipers, trapped accelerator pedals, possible loss of drive power to the wheels, and other issues.\nTesla started investigating the latest issue, involving a piece formally known as the cant rail, in January, according to filings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\"The cant rail, a stainless-steel exterior trim panel, can delaminate and detach from the vehicle,\" the notice said.\n\"A detached panel can become a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash.\"\nTesla told NHTSA it had received about 150 claims from drivers about the issue but was not aware of any accidents caused by the problem.\nIt estimated that the issue affected about 1% of vehicles involved in the recall.\nThe issue is covered under a warranty for new owners, and the company will replace the piece free-of-charge.\nTesla's shares have dropped nearly 40% since January, erasing the jump in value that it enjoyed after the 2024 US election.\nThe fall has been significantly more than the overall drop in the US stock market over that period.\nDan Ives, an analyst who has historically been very pro-Tesla, said on Thursday the firm was facing a \"tornado crisis moment\" due to brand damage from Musk's political role.\nThe political backlash adds to the challenges the company had already been facing from increased competition and an ageing line-up of offerings.\nThe Cybertruck was supposed to help reignite buzz around the brand and help it break into the lucrative market for pickup trucks in the US.\nIt hit the roads in late 2023 and carries a starting cost of more than $72,000 (\u00a355,500).",

        "text": "It all started with one question.\nA query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.\nAnd no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.\nInstead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.\nWhen Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.\nThe chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.\nLater, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.\nAnd just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".\nEven law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.\nAt first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".\nBefore its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.\n\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.\nBut then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nA tsunami of political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".\nWhen an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\" When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.\nMr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.\n\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.\n\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.\nNikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".\n\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.\n\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.\n\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.\nWhen the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"\nJoyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.\n\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.\nIndia's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.\nWhile some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.\nWith additional reporting by Nikita Yadav in Delhi\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "text": "After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth.\nTheir SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida.\nA pod of dolphins circled the craft.\nAfter a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\"The crew's doing great,\" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference.\nIt brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days.\nIt was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems.\n\"It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate.\nThanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a \"great partner\".\nThe journey home took 17 hours.\nThe astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment.\nThey will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families.\n\"The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,\" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut.\n\"All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time.\"\nThe saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.\nThey were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.\nBut the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.\nStarliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.\nSo Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.\nIt flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.\nThe only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.\nThe Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.\nThey carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.\nAnd despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.\nThroughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.\nNow the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.\nLong-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.\nIt can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity.\nBritish astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust.\n\"Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.\n\"But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"\nIn interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home.\nSpeaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice - to be back on Earth and feel Earth.\"",

        "text": "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.\nA team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.\nBut a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.\nIn a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".\nSouth Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.\nThe ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.\nIn a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.\nIt said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.\nThe statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".\n\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.\nThe department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.\nThe department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".\nThe alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.\nThe Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.\nThe base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.\nSouth African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.\nThese expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.\nBut on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".\nA South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".\nIncidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.\nPsychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.\n\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.\n\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.\nGabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.\n\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.\n\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.\nSources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.\nBut any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.\nAdditional reporting by Ed Habershon and Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "text": "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.\nThis is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.\nThat pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.\nOf the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nManufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\nSUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.\nEnvironmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.\nExperts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.\nMomentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles.

        "text": "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.\nThis is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.\nThat pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.\nOf the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nManufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\nSUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.\nEnvironmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.\nExperts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.\nMomentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.\nAnd in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend.

        "text": "Thousands of sites potentially contaminated with toxic chemicals in Britain have never been checked by councils, a BBC investigation has found.\nNine out of 10 \"high-risk\" areas have not been tested by councils responding to a BBC Freedom of Information request and scientists fear they could pose a health risk as they are thought to contain substances such as lead or arsenic.\nThe BBC Shared Data Unit found of 13,093 potentially toxic sites that councils have identified as high risk, only 1,465 have been inspected.\nThe UK government said local unitary authorities had a statutory duty to inspect potentially contaminated sites but councils claim they do not have the money to do it.\nThe Environmental Protection Act requires councils to list all potential contaminated sites, and inspect the high-risk ones to make sure people and property are not at risk.\nBut after contacting all 122 unitary authorities in Wales, Scotland and England about their contaminated land, 73 responded to the BBC's Shared Data Unit Freedom of Information request which revealed there were 430,000 potential sites identified in the early 2000s.\nOf those, 13,093 were considered to be potentially high risk, which experts said should have then been subject to physical testing. Yet, more than 11,000 of them remain unchecked to this day.\nHalf of Wales' 22 councils told the BBC they could not or would not give us figures - but those that did, identified 698 high-risk sites of which 586 have not been inspected.\nThe research comes after the release of new Netflix drama Toxic Town which tells the story of families fighting for justice following one of the UK's biggest environmental scandals.\nThe BBC's findings raise fresh questions about what exactly has been left beneath our feet from the UK's heavy industrial past.\n\"What we don't do in this country is do a full economic evaluation on the cost of things, including health and that feels almost criminal,\" said Dr Ian Mudway, a leading expert on the effect of pollution on human health.\n\"I'm not even certain we've achieved the point of scratching the surface.\"\nContaminated land is a site that might have been polluted from its previous use - it could have been a factory, power station, a railway line, landfill site, petrol station or dry cleaners.\nIf you live in a property constructed after 2000, any contamination issues should be covered by updated planning laws.\nBut if you live in a property built before 2000, the rules are less clear.\nWhere Robin Morris lives is home to more than 400 of Wales' 1,300 abandoned metal mines and its three rivers, the Ystwyth, Rheidol and the Clarach, are some of the most heavily-polluted in the UK.\nThe Cwmystwyth mines in north Ceredigion date back to the Bronze Age and were abandoned in 1950, but spoils including a high level of zinc, cadmium and lead scatter the landscape and have polluted the River Ystwyth below.\nMany Cwmystwyth locals, like Robin, have filtration systems installed if they receive their water from the hills where the old mines were.\n\"We installed an advance filtration system and were assured it would take absolutely everything,\" he said.\nThe BBC took a soil sample from Robin's garden on the banks of the Ystwyth and it revealed a very high reading of lead - well above the recommended safe level for gardening.\n\"It causes alarm bells to ring,\" Robin told BBC Wales Investigates.\n\"In light of the figures from your soil sample, we should have stopped growing vegetables long ago.\"\nIt's just one sample, but other things that have happened in the past now seem to make more sense.\n\"We had ducks and chickens, a couple of the ducks went lame and we did consult the vet, he thought it was because of lead contamination,\" added Robin.\nCeredigion council said it was liaising with Wales' environmental body National Resources Wales to continually assess the health impact from the area's mining legacy.\nDr Mudway insists there was \"no safe level\" of lead and told the BBC it could impact children's development as well as kidney and cardiovascular disease in adults.\n\"Nothing is more of a forever chemical than lead,\" added the environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London.\n\"This is a hazard that has not gone away and is still a clear and present danger to the population.\n\"It's one of the few chemical entities for which we can calculate a global burden of disease - between half a million to just under a million premature deaths per year because of the release of lead into our environment.\n\"When you talk about the cost of ensuring that land is safe... that costs money up front.\n\"The costs of potential health effects, especially if they contribute to chronic diseases which people live with for 10 or 20 years, or the costs of remediating land, after when you realise that it's a high-level, dwarf the profits made at the other end of that cycle. That feels almost criminal.\n\"The health cost is hardly considered at all.\"\nWhen Manon Chiswell was a toddler she suddenly stopped talking - doctors advised her family she was showing lots of autistic traits.\n\"I do have memories of being very closely monitored in Meithrin [nursery]... I always had an adult with me,\" said Manon, now 20.\n\"I couldn't speak... they had to use a traffic light system, and yes or no cards to redirect me and help me communicate.\"\nBut a blood test later found high levels of lead in Manon's blood.\nShe was not autistic, she had been poisoned.\nHer father, Huw Chiswell, believed Manon was most likely poisoned at their home in Cardiff, which was near an old industrial site.\n\"She used to eat earth [as a toddler] in the garden,\" he said.\n\"There were railway sidings not far from where we lived at the time, so it's difficult to draw any other conclusions really, because once she'd stopped the eating, she got better.\"\nBut it is not just about lead - a government report suggests that sites posing the greatest health risks were also contaminated by chemicals such as arsenic, nickel, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in soil or water.\nCampaigners want a new law forcing councils to keep a public register of all potential contaminated sites.\nIt is led by the parents of a seven-year-old boy who died from poisonous gas after the River Thames flooded their home in 2014, and they believe the fumes came from a nearby landfill.\nZane's law - named after Zane Gbangbola - also calls for measures such as more money for councils to identify and test possible sites.\n\"You have to know that it exists before you can protect yourself,\" said Zane's dad Kye Gbangbola, who was left paralysed after the gas poisoning.\n\"Until we have Zane's Law people will remain unprotected.\"\nWhen tighter regulations on dealing with potentially contaminated land became law 25 years ago, the minister that pushed them through wanted just that.\nNow John Selwyn Gummer feels UK government funding cuts has meant far fewer inspections.\n\"There is no way in which local authorities can do this job without having the resources,\" said Lord Deben.\n\"Successive governments have under-provided for the work that we need to do.\"\nSeveral councils have told the BBC that funding is the reason they had stopped checking possible contaminated land.\nPhil Hartley was one of hundreds of officers across the UK that used to check potential sites as Newcastle's former council contamination officer.\nHe said the central government grant removal had led to a \"collapse\" in checks.\n\"Since the money dried up very, very few councils proactively go out looking for contaminated land sites because the council doesn't want to take the risk of finding them,\" said Mr Hartley.\n\"There's a possibility that some people's health is being threatened, which is not great.\"\nThe UK government said local authorities had a statutory duty to inspect potentially contaminated sites, require remediation and maintain a public register of remediated land.\n\"Any risk to public health from contaminated land is a serious matter,\" a spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.\nThey also asked the Environment Agency to produce a new state of contaminated land report to provide the \"best possible baseline of data to measure future policies related to contaminated land against\".\nThe bodies that represent councils in Wales and England both said a lack of cash meant they could not fulfil their duty.\nThe Welsh Local Government Association said while Wales' 22 councils took their responsibility to check sites \"seriously\", progress was \"increasingly constrained by a lack of dedicated funding and specialist resources\".\nEngland's Local Government Association said: \"Without adequate funding, councils will continue to struggle to provide crucial services - with devastating consequences for those who rely on them.\"\nAdditional reporting by Patrick Hughes\nYou can watch Britain's Toxic Secret on BBC iPlayer and BBC One on Thursday 13 March at 20:30 GMT",

        "text": "A private spacecraft that landed lopsided on the Moon does not have enough power to complete its mission, says the company Intuitive Machines.\nAthena touched down on the lunar South Pole shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST) on Thursday, but it later was revealed the craft had landed on its side.\nIt was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.\nIntuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.\n\"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,\" the company said in a statement about the mission called IM-2.\nLast year Intuitive Machines' first spacecraft also landed on its side, breaking a leg.\nIt is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.\n\"Clearly the mission can only have achieved a fraction of its science goals,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, lunar scientist at the Open University.\nBut the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.\nAthena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.\nIt is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.\nThe sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.\nRadio communications from Earth are also more difficult.\nAnd Dr Barber says some of the instruments are likely to have been turned on briefly on Thursday, including the drill and a mass spectrometer that could identify chemicals in gases released from the lunar soil.\nThat is likely to generate some useful scientific information, he says.\nThe shortcomings of IM-2 are in contrast to the successful landing of a different private craft on Sunday by the company Firefly Aerospace in a different area of the Moon.\nNasa wants to send four astronauts to the Moon in 2027 in its Artemis programme. Its long-term goal is to take humans to Mars, using the Moon as a stepping stone.\nIt is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.\n\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\".",

        "text": "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.\nThey've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.\nThe researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.\nAnd gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.\nThe discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.\nIts main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.\nBut a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.\nIt then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.\nProf Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.\n\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.\n\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"\nThe research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.\nThey were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.\nAnd when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.\nProf Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.\n\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"\nBut he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.\nMore than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.\nBut despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.\nAgainst that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.\nDr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.\n\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"\nShe also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\".",

        "text": "Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space.\nThe target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet.\nMarine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds \u2013 all feed on these diminutive creatures.\nHowever, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures.\n\"Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,\" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK.\n\"They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk.\"\nResearchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.\nThe key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it.\nDr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect.\n\"We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],\" she explained. \"Then we add another krill and take another measurement.\"\nThis analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space.\nKrill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them.\nThey are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill, krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants.\nHowever, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable.\nMr Downie said: \"We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas.\n\"[This project could] give us a new tool to help monitor and safeguard this vital species.\"",

        "text": "The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals.\nSamples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds.\nThese include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA.\nThis doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago.\nScientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System.\n\"What we've learned from it is amazing,\" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London.\n\"It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?\"\nThe findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy.\nGrabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted.\nA spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023.\nAbout 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove.\n\"Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,\" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks.\nAbout a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.\nThe new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds.\nThese include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.\nThe study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too.\nSome of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now.\n\"It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,\" said Prof Russell.\nThis latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth.\n\"The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,\" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum.\nThe idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible.\nBut Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding with other planets too.\n\"Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,\" said Dr King.\n\"And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?\"\nIt's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer.\nThey have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore.",

Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause,\" SpaceX posted on X.\n\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"\nUnverified footage shared on social media shows what appears to be the rocket breaking up in flames.\nAnd footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind.\n\"Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!\" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky.\nHe also said \"improved versions\" of the ship and booster were \"already waiting for launch\".\n\"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\" Musk said a short while later, adding that \"nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month\".\nFootage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream.\nThe Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission.\nThe Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned.\nBut then SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship.\nThe Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware \"an anomaly occurred\" during the SpaceX mission.\n\"The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.

        "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company has blasted its first rocket into orbit in a bid to challenge the dominance of Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nThe New Glenn rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 02:02 local time (07:02 GMT).\nIt firmly pits the world's two richest men against each other in a commercial space race, vying to fly bigger and more powerful rockets.\nBoth want to populate the skies with more satellites, run private space stations, and provide transport for regular trips by people to the Moon.\n\"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\" Musk wrote in a post to Bezos on X.\nDave Limp, CEO of Bezos's space company Blue Origin, said he was \"incredibly proud\".\n\"We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring,\" he added.\nBezos's team overcame technical barriers that caused delays earlier this week when ice formation halted a launch.\nBlue Origin's employees and crowds gathered near Cape Canaveral cheered as the 98 meters-high rocket hurtled into orbit.\nBut the company failed to land New Glenn's main rocket engine, or booster, onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt had hoped that the booster would be reusable for future launches but after about 20 minutes of flight, the company confirmed it had lost the engine.\nBezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business.\nThe New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago.\nThe rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services.\nThat project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service.\nJeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted \"millions of people working and living in space.\"\nFor years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021.\nBut Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year.\nAnd SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today.\nSome experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations.\n\"What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,\" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK.\nGovernments have historically spent billions on building rockets and sending missions into space.\nBut US space agency NASA is increasingly moving away from relying only on public money and has issued huge contracts to private companies to provide rockets and other space services.\nElon Musk's SpaceX has already received billions of dollars worth of space contracts.\nHis close relationship with the next US president, Donald Trump, could strengthen his company further.",

Instead, it said the protests were led by local indigenous leaders who were opposed to the pipeline.\nThe nine-person jury reached a verdict on Wednesday after about two days of deliberating.\nThe case was heard at a court in Mandan, about 100 miles (160km) north of where the protests took place.\nTrey Cox, a lawyer for Energy Transfer, said during closing arguments that Greenpeace's actions caused between $265m to $340m in damages. He asked the jury to award the company that amount, plus additional damages.\nConstruction of the Dakota Access Pipeline gained international attention during President Donald Trump's first term, as Native American groups set up an encampment trying to block it from passing near Standing Rock.\nThe protests, which saw acts of violence and vandalism, started in April 2016 and ended in February 2017, when the National Guard and police cleared away the demonstrators.\nAt the peak, over 10,000 protesters were on site. The group included more than 200 Native American tribes, hundreds of US military veterans, actors and political leaders - including current US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr.\nThe 1,172-mile pipeline has been operating since 2017. However, it still lacks a key permit to operate under Lake Oahe in South Dakota, and local tribes have pushed for an extensive environmental review of the project.\nDuring the three-week trial, jurors heard from Energy Transfer's co-founder and board chairman Kelcy Warren, who said in a video deposition that protesters had created \"a total false narrative\" about his company.\n\"It was time to fight back,\" he said.\nEnergy Transfer's lawyer Mr Cox told the court that Greenpeace had exploited the Dakota Access Pipeline to \"promote its own selfish agenda\".\nAttorneys for Greenpeace argued that the group did not lead the protests, but merely helped support \"nonviolent, direct-action training\".\nIn response to the verdict, Greenpeace International's general counsel Kristin Casper said \"Energy Transfer hasn't heard the last of us in this fight\".\n\"We will not back down, we will not be silenced,\" she said.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said he believes \"the verdict's magnitude will have a chilling effect on environmental and other public interest litigation\".\n\"It may encourage litigants in other states to file similar lawsuits,\" he told the BBC.\nEnergy Transfer's legal action named Greenpeace USA, as well as its Washington DC-based funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc and its Amsterdam-based parent group Greenpeace International.\nGreenpeace has counter-sued Energy Transfer in Dutch court, claiming the oil firm is attempting to unfairly use the legal system to silence critics.\nThe lawsuit, filed earlier this month, seeks to recover all damages and costs.",

        "text": "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.\nThis is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.\nThat pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.\nOf the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nManufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\nSUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.\nEnvironmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.\nExperts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.\nMomentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles.

        "text": "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.\nThis is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.\nThat pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.\nOf the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nManufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.\nSUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.\nEnvironmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.\nExperts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.\nMomentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles.

But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.\n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here.

This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.\n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest.

        "text": "After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home.\nTheir stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.\nThe pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\nThey undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .\nTheir landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.\nIt will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.\nThe SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.\nAs it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.\nFinally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.\nHelen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.\n\"They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,\" she told BBC News.\nThe saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.\nThey were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.\nBut the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.\nStarliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.\nSo Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.\nIt flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.\nThe arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.\nThe Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.\nThey've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.\nAnd despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.\nThroughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.\nSpeaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.\n\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.\nSuni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.\n\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"\nThe pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.\nBut Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.\nGarrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.\n\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.\n\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"\nOnce the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.\nLong duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.\nIt can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.\nGarrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.\n\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.\"",

        "text": "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.\nArchaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.\nThe excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.\nThe site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.\n\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.\n\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"\nThe site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.\nEarlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.\nOn the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.\n\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.\nThe wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.\nOther artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.\nThe basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.\n\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.\n\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"\nIt was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.\nBut the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.\nThe discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.\nThe Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.\nFor the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.\n\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.\n\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"\nAnd so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.\nBut Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.\n\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"\nThis is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.\nParts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.\nChris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.\n\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.\n\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\"",

        "text": "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.\nThe document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.\nBut now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.\nMore work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.\n\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.\nSome letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.\nHundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.\nIn the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.\nThe University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.\n\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.\nBut the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.\nIt was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.\nInside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.\n\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.\nThe scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.\n\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.\nAfter that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.\nSo the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.\n\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.\n\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"\nLast year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.\nIts subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.\nThe Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.\nFor Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.\n\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.\nSign up here to receive our new weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

        "text": "The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals.\nSamples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds.\nThese include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA.\nThis doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago.\nScientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System.\n\"What we've learned from it is amazing,\" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London.\n\"It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?\"\nThe findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy.\nGrabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted.\nA spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023.\nAbout 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove.\n\"Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,\" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks.\nAbout a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.\nThe new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds.\nThese include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.\nThe study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too.\nSome of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now.\n\"It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,\" said Prof Russell.\nThis latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth.\n\"The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,\" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum.\nThe idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible.\nBut Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding with other planets too.\n\"Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,\" said Dr King.\n\"And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?\"\nIt's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer.\nThey have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore.",

        "text": "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.\nArchaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.\nThe spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.\n\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.\nAnalysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.\nThe bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.\nThey had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.\n\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.\nA third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.\nThe archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.\nAn entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.\nThe discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.\n\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"\nThose lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.\nThey would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.\nNext they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.\nFinally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.\n\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.\nThe bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.\nA huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.\nThe residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.\nNext door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.\nThe skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.\n\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.\n\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"\nAnalysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.\nThe woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.\n\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"\nAn assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.\nBut it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.\nThese are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.\nThe gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.\n\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"\nDr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.\nJust behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.\nWith a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.\n\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.\n\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.\n\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"\nThe excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.\n\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.\n\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.\n\"It's a magic moment for the life of Pompeii, and this excavation work offers us the possibility to share this with the public.\"\nYou can watch Pompeii: The New Dig \u2013 House of Treasures on Mon 20 Jan at 21:00 on BBC Two, and also on the BBC iPlayer.",

        "text": "Listen to Esme read this article\nDonald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.\nSince taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.\nPlus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".\nAnd yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.\nCritical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.\nSo, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?\nTrump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).\nElizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.\nShe says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.\nWithin two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.\nSuch has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"\nHe went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.\nThe weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"\nFailure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".\nChina's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.\n\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\nDaisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"\nSome minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.\nChina has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).\n\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.\nShe says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.\nWhat is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"\nAs he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.\nThe key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.\nIn the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.\nThe Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.\nBy August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.\nAnd yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.\nBut Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.\n\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.\n\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"\nThere could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.\nThe exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.\nAlthough work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"\nAs a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.\nAnalysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.\nMIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.\nHe adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.\nIf Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.\nCarl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"\nHe also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"\nBut the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"\nFor those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "text": "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".\nThis was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nThe threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.\nTo pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.\nVery large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.\nThe potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.\nWith this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.\nThe plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.\nIn recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.\nThe challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.\nThree hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.\n\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.\nIn 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.\nThe switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.\nThe search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.\nBut a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.\n\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"\nProf Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.\nGPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.\nThe NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.\nWhen optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.\n\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.\nThe NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.\nEventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.\nYet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"\nWhile this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".\nBy carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.\nBut the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.\nHenry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".\nQuantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.\nGPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.\n\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.\n\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".\nThe ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.\nThis would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.\nQEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.\nThat process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.\nQuantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.\nBut it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.\n\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.\n\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"\nProminent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.\nBringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?\nOne day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "text": "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.\nHe set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.\n\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.\nLater, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"\nMr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.\nSince then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.\nDuring the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.\nThe photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.\nAnd yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.\nThe question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.\nThe Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.\nIn the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.\nDespite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.\nAnd yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.\nThey have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.\nOn the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.\n\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"\nMany presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.\nBut since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.\nThat is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.\n\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026\n\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"\nOne of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.\nBy contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.\nBezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).\nCompetition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.\nStarship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.\n\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.\n\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.\n\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"\nThe OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.\n\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".\nNasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".\n(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)\nIt was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.\nNasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.\nBut the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"\nThe current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.\nThe model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.\nDr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.\n\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"\nMoves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.\nAmong those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.\nThe heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.\nSpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.\nThe ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"\nProf Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".\nBut changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.\n\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.\nAlthough Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.\nThe creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.\n\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.\n\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"\nWhere that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.\nOthers fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.\nThere is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.\nBut if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.\nAnd there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.\nBut industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.\n\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"\nUltimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.\nBut the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.\n\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"\nAsked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.\n\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".\nTop image credit: Getty\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "text": "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.\nFatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.\nThis is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.\nIt is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.\nBut the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?\nAnd if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.\nProf Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"\nFatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.\nThe first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.\nThe fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.\nProf Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.\n\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"\nIf the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.\nBut while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.\nOne of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.\n\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"\nOne member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.\nThe possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.\nHowever all those possibilities require funding.\nThe technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.\nOn the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.\nThe chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.\n\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.\nModern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.\n\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.\n\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"\nIn the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.\nIn all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.\nThe fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.\nIt states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".\nThe report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.\nProfessor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".\nShe said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.\n\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"\nDr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.\n\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"\nAccording to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.\n\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".\nAnother issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.\n\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.\n\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".\nNot all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.\nA further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.\n\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"\nIn response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.\nBut \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.\nMany applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.\nBut Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.\n\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".\nScientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.\nMore worrisome is that progress in bioengineering could one day lead to the creation of dangerous superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.\nA group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.\nWriting in the journal Science, they said that while the capability to create mirror life is likely at least a decade away and would require large investments and major technical advances, these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.\nWithout action to reduce the risks, developments in biotechnology could increase the risk of bioterrorism in the future\nGovernment and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.\nProf Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.\n\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".\nTop picture credit: Keam George Agency\nBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

        "text": "It was terrible timing. In the late morning of Tuesday 6 January, a \"life-threatening and destructive\" windstorm was heading for the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. The local office of the US National Weather Service published a strongly worded alert at roughly 10:30am local time. At almost that exact moment, a fire erupted in the Palisades neighbourhood of LA.\n\"The fire was able to get started, get a foothold, and then the wind came in and pushed it really, really hard,\" says Ellie Graeden, co-chief executive of RedZone Analytics, which makes wildfire modelling products for the insurance industry. \"This is really as bad as it can get.\"\nThe fire exploded, followed by other wildfires in nearby areas. Thousands of homes and other buildings have been razed. Sunset Boulevard is in ruins. At the time of writing, LA's fires have killed at least 10 people. Officials have ordered nearly 180,000 people to evacuate.\nThe fires now rank as the most destructive in LA's history, with losses already expected to exceed $250bn (\u00a3206.2bn).\nWe still don't know why they started, however. It might have been a lightning strike, downed power lines, a carelessly discarded cigarette. There could be a more nefarious reason, arson. Most wildfires are caused by humans.\nBut as the LA authorities begin to piece together what initially sparked the blazes, the speed with which those first flames became raging, rapidly spreading infernos is symptomatic of something happening far more widely.\nIn this case, a confluence of environmental conditions came together with devastating timing. A combination of long-term drought and heavy rainfall in the days before provided the fuel, while powerful \u2013 and at times hurricane-force \u2013 winds fanned the fires into raging infernos.\nAt the outset, the Santa Ana winds as they are known \u2013 strong and gusty winds that blow from inland towards the coast \u2013 reached speeds of 80mph (129km/h), supercharging the inferno.\nDisastrously, the high winds prevented some firefighting helicopters and planes from taking to the skies in order to dump water on the burning areas.\n\"Without that air support, we're basically playing whack-a-mole to prevent losses at specific points,\" says Ms Graeden.\nThese conditions come against the backdrop of climate change, which is not only increasing the risk of wildfires around the world, but also making them particularly explosive. This is when relatively small blazes rapidly \"blow up\" so suddenly and with such ferocity that they become difficult to control.\nIn California, the risk of such extremely fast-growing fires has increased by an estimated 25% due to human-caused climate change, according to some models.\nRising temperatures and prolonged periods of drought are stripping vegetation and dead plant material of their moisture, meaning when a fire does start, there can be no stopping it.\nMatt Jones, an Earth system scientist at the University of East Anglia, who studies the impact of climate change on wildfires, notes that, in 2022 and 2023, LA received extraordinary amounts of rain. Some 52.46in (133cm) of precipitation hit downtown LA during this period, which was nearly a record.\nThat excessive rain helped plants in the area to grow but then, in 2024, the weather changed. Last year was extremely dry in contrast to the previous two years. It means that there is currently a large volume of dried-out vegetation scattered around southern California.\n\"We're left with a really explosive situation,\" says Mr Jones.\nThere was also the significant influence of the windstorm. The Santa Ana winds go by various names, depending on where you live. Known as the F\u00f6hn or F\u00f6hnwind in the Alpine regions of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they are associated in folk belief with a range of symptoms including migraines, depression, sleeplessness, confusion, and increased risk of accidents.\nOne account published in a scientific journal in 1911 reveals the dramatic effects of the F\u00f6hnwind in Innsbruck, Austria: \"This wind often blows with great violence, and unless one's windows are promptly closed everything in the house is speedily covered with a thick layer of dust.\"\nClimate change is creating hotter conditions in some locations where Santa Ana-like winds occur, meaning that the impact or potential consequences \u2013 especially in terms of rapidly escalating wildfires \u2013 is worsening.\nAccording to some research, these winds are becoming more common in parts of the world due to climate change.\nThe effect on wildfires of such an increase could be profound. In Switzerland, for example, researchers found F\u00f6hn winds led to fires burning three times as much area than on days where there were no such winds.\nFires that spread very quickly are particularly dangerous \u2013 not just because of the threat to human life and property, but also because of how widespread those fires can become.\nResearch published last year examined the frequency of \"blow up\" fire events that suddenly escalate. Notably, it was areas where fires burned intensely for relatively short periods of time that ended up burning larger areas overall. \"Single-day extreme fire spread events are disproportionately shaping North American landscapes,\" the authors wrote.\nThey estimated that, between 2002 and 2021, North American fires that burned more than 1,704 hectares (4210 acres) in a single day burned an average of 2.3 million hectares (5.7 million acres) annually overall.\nMediterranean California, where LA is located, is especially prone to rapidly escalating, wide-burning fires, according to the study.\nWhile the downslope Santa Ana winds appear to have accelerated the LA wildfires, very different conditions can also cause fires to blow up. In the absence of powerful winds, wildfires can sometimes make their own weather, says Mr Jones.\n\"They generate their own, strong, localised winds, which can affect both the pace at which the fire spreads but also trigger erratic directional changes,\" he explains.\nAs a blaze heats the air above it, it can create updrafts powerful enough to form huge pyrocumulative clouds in the sky above. The appearance of such a cloud can indicate that a wildfire is about to escalate rapidly, or that this process has already begun, research published in 2021 found.\nSuch storm clouds can cause lightning strikes, which could ignite yet more fires nearby.\nThis interplay of wind and fire is a common theme. \"You can, in certain parts of the globe, get a rapidly growing fire during [the] passage of a front \u2013 a weather system that basically gives you the wind but doesn't bring you the precipitation,\" explains John Abatzoglou, professor of climatology at the University of California, Merced.\nFires tend to run up hillsides in the absence of Santa Ana winds, says Prof Abatzoglou, though in places like California, the Santa Ana winds can push fires down hills instead. Similar downslope winds were also thought to have played a role in the deadly Maui wildfires in Hawaii in 2023.\nIn either case, fast-developing fires are very problematic when they occur near towns and cities. \"Within a matter of hours from ignition you had huge numbers of people that were impacted,\" says Prof Abatzoglou, referring to the situation in LA.\nA controversial question, especially in highly populated places such as California, is whether it is still safe to live in such close proximity to areas prone to these disasters.\nInsurers have gradually backed away from the state in recent years, cutting the number of policies available to homeowners, though last month the California Department of Insurance issued a landmark regulation that aimed to make insurance more accessible.\nSome residents have also been looking into ways to attempt to fireproof their homes.\nThose with the greatest resources might take inspiration from the Getty Villa, a museum in the Pacific Palisades. (Though perhaps not without irony. The museum was originally built by J Paul Getty, an early 20th-Century oil tycoon.)\nStaff routinely trim trees and shrubs in the gardens to ensure there is not an excess of vegetation available to provide fuel for fires. The building's galleries also have double walls and staff can control, to some extent, the flow of hot air into the villa via the air conditioning system.\nBut the fact that fires can leapfrog for several miles makes containment difficult. Embers from burning vegetation can be whipped up and carried by the wind, allowing new fires to ignite some distance away. Rather than catching fire from direct contact with flames, many homes begin to burn due to embers that can fly miles, entering through eaves or gable vents.\nHomeowners can replace porous vents with fire-resistant ones designed to keep out windswept embers, and install ember-resistant gutter guards that allow rainwater but stop vegetation from piling up on the roofline.\nDespite the grandeur of some LA mansions, however, many were left ravaged by the recent fires \u2013 including multiple homes belonging to celebrities. The biggest wildfires could likely overwhelm even the most fortified properties.\nLA does try to reduce the risk of gigantic fires taking hold. The city rents goats, for instance, so that the animals can graze brush from hillsides.\n\"The reception is overwhelmingly positive wherever we go,\" goat herder Michael Choi said in a recent interview. \"It's a win-win scenario as far as I can tell.\"\nThere are also efforts to use high-tech camera-based surveillance systems to watch for developing wildfires, and supercomputers that try to predict when fires are most likely to occur. That said, these systems were in place in LA last week but that did not stop the latest fires claiming lives and leaving vast areas in ruins.\nHomeowners who live in wildfire-prone locations need to think about their own vulnerability, says Ms Graeden: \"This is a risk that is not necessarily seasonal anymore. This is the type of risk that people need to be taking very seriously at all times.\"\nShe recommends clearing as much vegetation from around residential properties as possible, and installing a fire-resistant roof or a sprinkler system. Having an evacuation plan in place could also save lives.\nWhen efforts to repair and rebuild homes in LA eventually get underway, it is possible some may turn to fire-resistant materials such as bricks made of earth.\nBut at the heart of it is a deeper question. \"We built civilisation that [functions] in one climate and now we are, through burning fossil fuels, fundamentally changing [that climate],\" argues Margaret Klein Salamon, a climate activist and leader of the Climate Emergency Fund, a non-profit that funds climate activism.\n\"This is what the future looks like unless we make drastic changes,\" she adds, arguing that the problem of climate change will not go away simply by relocating from some of the worst-affected places.\nAs the world gets hotter, and as rainfall patterns become more erratic, we may see fires like those in LA erupt with increasing frequency. Abatzoglou highlights the 2024 wildfires in Chile and Greece as key examples in which very dry conditions set the stage for catastrophe.\nIn 2023 fires hit Canada and burned an area larger than England - these were also fuelled by high temperatures and drought.\nClimate change brings dangerous variability, notes Abatzoglou. That swing in weather we've seen in southern California, from a period of heavy rainfall to suddenly hot, dry, fire-sparking conditions \u2013 known as \"hydroclimate whiplash\" \u2013 is clearly very problematic.\n\"It's really these sequences that I think are important when it comes to fire,\" says Abatzoglou.\n\"Rapid swings between unusually wet to unusually dry conditions. That's something we are seeing across the globe.\"\nBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

        "text": "Hundreds of volunteers will attempt to set a new world record on Friday when they gather to clean the River Taff.\nOrganisers said 1,330 people have signed up to attend the event along the river between its source in the Bannau Brycheiniog national park, also known as the Brecon Beacons, and Cardiff Bay.\nThe current world record for a volunteer river clean-up stands at 329 people, which was achieved on the River Ganges in India in February 2025.\nKate Strong, who was inspired to organise the Taff Tidy project, said she believed the \"best way\" to raise awareness of \"the importance of looking after our health and the natural world\" was to motivate with a world record.\nMs Strong, who is an ex-triathlon champion and holds multiple world cycling records on a static bike, said: \"I think we don't talk enough about what we can do every single day to help our rivers.\n\"Yes, we are organising a world record clean up event by picking up our rubbish but the food we eat at home directly affects our rivers systems, what we flush down our toilets directly affects our river systems.\n\"So I think we really need to look after our fresh water system that supports life.\"\nSchool children, community groups and others will be expected to collect litter at multiple locations along the banks of the river for a 30-minute period from 12:00 GMT on Friday.\nA Guinness World Records adjudicator will assess the evidence gathered from eight locations along the Taff before a result is declared shortly afterwards.\n\"At every single location there'll be five key volunteers that are operating on behalf of Guinness and they'll be observing the whole infrastructure and recording the entire clean up for that day,\" said Ms Strong.\n\"The paperwork will then be driven to Cardiff Bay where myself and the adjudicator for Guinness will be going through the paperwork to ensure we kept within the rules, the right amount of people turned up and that we have broken the record.\"\nAmong those taking part in the clean up is Dr Numair Masud, a freshwater ecologist from Cardiff University, after the event he will then test the samples, identifying how much the clean up will have benefited the water quality in the river.\n\"It is worth remembering that the River Taff was considered ecologically dead once upon a time.\n\"So it really is a reminder that things can improve because of human initiative,\" said Dr Masud.\n\"Analysing waste along the River Taff along those eight key locations will be incredibly important because not only is it going to be the largest ever river clean-up, it may potentially be the largest ever individual points survey for plastic pollutants, for example.\n\"And as someone who is working on plastic pollution that is incredibly important,\" he added.\nDr Masud said the event would also be used to survey local people about human behaviour which leads to littering.\n\"If we are serious about making a difference to our rivers and the natural world as a whole we need to be patient,\" he said.\n\"We need to think about long term-ism rather than short term-ism.\n\"Human beings as a species we like quick fixes, and the Taff Tidy is a single moment in time.\n\"But what it's trying to create, or what Kate and I are trying to create, is a legacy to remind people that we need to be in this together for the long haul. Otherwise, it's not going to work.\"\nLouise Tambini from the charity Keep Wales Tidy says the Taff was particularly vulnerable to the effects of litter, and Cardiff \"gets the brunt of that\".\n\"You've got lots and lots of rivers feeding into the Taff, so in a flood event, and we have lots and lots of flood events, you get tonnes and tonnes of waste coming down the river.\n\"If you walk anywhere down the bottom of the Taff you'll see very high strand lines of all the plastics.\"\nGail Davies-Walsh from Afonydd Cymru said that improvement in water quality had slowed down.\n\"In the 1970s, the River Taff catchment was one of the most grossly polluted rivers in Wales, a consequence of the industrial heritage of the south Wales valleys.\n\"Significant water quality and ecological improvement resulted in this catchment, but in recent time that improvement has most certainly slowed.\"\nShe added reports from environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW) showed no improvement in three years and emerging concerns from chemicals and ammonia that impacts fish.\nNRW insisted the water quality of Welsh rivers \"remains firmly at the top of our agenda.\"\nRhian Thomas, NRW's sustainable water manager, said it was \"driving improvements through robust water regulation and pollution incident response.\"\n\"The Welsh government's new law banning the supply of certain single-use plastic products will help to reduce the flow of plastic pollution into our environment.\n\"There is no simple solution to this societal challenge. River clean-ups are also an important part of the solution, and we support the great work of the many volunteers that help.\n\"We need a collaborative solution, with a mixture of better regulation, enforcement and education \u2013 not something any one organisation can do alone.\"",

It's got some muscle mass to build back up on its wings, but we should be happy to see it go in a couple of weeks.\"\nThe charity has now shared the following update on social media: \"When the pigeon was first admitted, we were concerned about its poor condition after going a week without food or water. Their chances seemed slim, but we still got to work with rehydration and, eventually, supportive feeding.\n\"We're happy to report that the pigeon is now stable and doing much better. It's going to take some time to improve their feather condition and overall health, but we're happy with their improvement so far.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

        "text": "People will be protected from landslips, with more than \u00a334m being invested to improve safety at coal tip sites across Wales.\nThere have been a number of incidents, such as in November 2024 during Storm Bert, when homes in Cwmtillery, Blaenau Gwent, were damaged and people evacuated.\nResidents in the village said they felt like they had been forgotten, with one saying the money had come too late following a harrowing six months for people in the area.\nIn January, the Welsh government said up to \u00a3600m could be needed to ensure the safety of 2,000 old coal tips in Wales.\nThe 34m in funding will see safety work take place at 130 sites in 10 local authority areas - with \u00a311.5m focused on Rhondda Cynon Taf, which has the most coal tips classified as posing the highest risk.\n\"It's all too late. It should have been done a long time ago,\" said Cwmtillery resident Russell Martin.\n\"Three years or more, four it's been around. We knew it could have happened. Not only that, it's deterioration of properties now.\"\nHe described sand bags being a feature of life now and concerns when there's bad weather, adding: \"If we were not of this age we wouldn't stay here.\n\"We are not moving now at 72 and 71 years of age.\"\n\"We haven't got a council house and can't just say 'you move me, I don't want to live here, I want to move from here',\" said another resident, Diane Morgan.\n\"We've put a lot of money into this [house], we still are, we've worked really hard. It's upsetting. Why should we live under this threat?\"\nShe gave a cautious welcome to the funding news, describing the \"pure carnage\" of \"two trees, massive boulders, slurry down the hill\", during Storm Bert.\nBut she also said she had sent photos to the authorities in the past following storms when rivers of water had been running down the street, saying: \"It's like we don't exist.\"\nWith more storms than ever happening, she called on the authorities to \"get your priorities right\".\nDeputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies described the Welsh government funding as \"unprecedented\", with it sitting alongside \u00a325m pledged by the UK government last October.\nWith coal tips dotted around the south Wales valleys - a legacy of the area's mining past - fears have existed for some time about the potential risks they pose.\nThese concerns were heightened in 2020, after a landslip in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nSome 60,000 tonnes of spoil material slid down the side of an old coal tip, entering a river.\nThis led to the launch of a Coal Tip Safety Taskforce between the Welsh and UK governments.\nA total of 2,573 disused coal tips were identified, with 360 classed as having \"the potential to impact public safety\" and requiring regular inspection.\nA review, commissioned by the Welsh government, found existing laws on tip safety - introduced in the wake of the Aberfan disaster in 1966 - no longer provided \"an effective management framework\", as they were designed for a time when there was an active coal industry.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest number of the most risky category D tips in Wales.\nThe local authority area will receive \u00a311.49m, with Neath Port Talbot getting \u00a36.34m, Merthyr Tydfil \u00a34.2m, Caerphilly \u00a32.78m, Blaenau Gwent \u00a31.997m, Torfaen \u00a31.98m and Bridgend \u00a31.8m, in the major awards.\nWork will be carried out by local authorities, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW).\n\"These tips are a visible symbol of how coal mining shaped the valleys but many years later, the tips are still causing issues around safety and pollution which have to be addressed urgently,\" said Neath Port Talbot council leader Steve Hunt.\nNRW will get \u00a32.298m, while Wrexham will get \u00a3823,000, Cardiff \u00a3110,000 and Monmouthshire \u00a316,000.\nMr Irranca-Davies, who also has responsibility for climate change, said he hoped a Disused Mine and Quarry Tips (Wales) Bill introduced in the Senedd last December, would provide further reassurances.\n\"If passed, this ground-breaking legislation will establish a dedicated public body to safeguard against threats from tip instability,\" he said.\n\"The new authority would take full responsibility for assessment, registration, monitoring and management of these sites across Wales, helping to provide peace of mind to nearby communities.\"",

        "text": "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.\nSome of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.\nThis early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.\nMore data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.\n\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"\nThe discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.\nBut observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.\nAlthough we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.\nSeveral experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.\nLast year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.\nInstead, a year on, that blip has grown.\n\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth\n\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.\nThe data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.\n\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.\n\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.\n\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"\nSo what is causing the variation?\n\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.\n\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"\nDESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.\n\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.\nMore details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.\nThe DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK.",

        "text": "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.\nSome of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.\nThis early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.\nMore data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.\n\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"\nThe discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.\nBut observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.\nAlthough we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.\nSeveral experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.\nLast year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.\nInstead, a year on, that blip has grown.\n\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth\n\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.\nThe data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.\n\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.\n\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.\n\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"\nSo what is causing the variation?\n\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.\n\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"\nDESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.\n\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.\nMore details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.\nThe DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK.",

        "text": "Spending time in space and having an unrivalled view of planet Earth is an experience many of us dream of.\nHowever, the human body evolved to function in the gravity of Earth. So time in the weightlessness of space can take years from which to fully recover.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are back on Earth after their eight-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) unexpectedly became a nine-month enforced stay. Now, their recovery begins.\n\"Space is by far the most extreme environment that humans have ever encountered and we've just not evolved to handle the extreme conditions,\" Prof Damian Bailey, who studies human physiology, at the University of South Wales, says.\nEntering space changes the human body \u2013 and initially that feels awesome.\n\"It feels like a holiday,\" astronaut Tim Peake, who went to the ISS in 2015, says.\n\"Your heart is having an easy time.\n\"Your muscles and bones are having an easy time.\n\"You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero-gravity environment.\"\nImagine spending weeks lounging around in bed and never having to get up \u2013 this is actually one technique scientists use to investigate the impact of zero gravity - and you start to get the picture.\nBut when it comes to muscle, it is a case of use it or lose it.\nEven the simple act of standing still uses muscles throughout the body to hold you upright.\nAnd that is not happening in the microgravity on board the ISS.\nMuscle strength takes on a different meaning when everything is practically weightless.\nThe heart and your blood vessels also have an easier time as they no longer have to pump blood against gravity - and they start to weaken.\nAnd the bones become weaker and more brittle.\nThere should be a balance between the cells breaking down old bone and those making new.\nBut that balance is disrupted without the feedback and resistance of working against gravity.\n\"Every month, about 1% of their bone and muscles are going to wither away \u2013 it's accelerated ageing,\" Prof Bailey says.\nAnd this becomes apparent on the return to Earth.\nThe video below shows the astronauts needing support to get their bodies out of the capsule and on to a stretcher.\nAll of this is why astronauts go up to space in tip-top physical condition.\nThen, their daily routine involves two hours of exercise \u2013 a combination of treadmill, cycling machine and weights - to maintain as much muscle and bone health as possible.\nAnd now, Suni and Butch will start an intense exercise training programme to regain their lost function.\n\"It will probably take them a few months to build up their muscle mass,\" Dr Helen Sharman, who was the first Briton in space, says.\nBone mass could take a \"couple of years\" until it recovers - but even then, there are \"subtle changes in the type of bone that we do rebuild after returning to Earth that may never return to completely normal\".\nBut that is just muscle and bone \u2013 space changes the whole body.\nEven the types of good bacteria living in us \u2013 the microbiome \u2013 are altered.\nThe fluids in the body also shift in microgravity.\nInstead of being pulled down towards the legs as on Earth, fluid drifts up towards the chest and face.\nA puffy face is one of the first noticeable changes in the body.\nBut this can also lead to swelling in the brain and changes in the eye, including to the optic nerve, retina and even the shape of the eye.\nAnd this \"spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome\" can lead to blurred vision and potentially irreversible damage.\nMicrogravity also distorts the vestibular system, which is how you balance and sense which way is up.\nIn space, there is no up, down or sideways.\nIt can be disorientating when you go up - and again when you return to Earth.\nTim Peake says: \"That initial phase of stopping feeling dizzy, of regaining your balance and having strength to walk around normally, that's just two or three days.\n\"Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"",

        "text": "The Grangemouth industrial complex is one of Scotland's major manufacturing facilities - but the imminent closure of Scotland's only oil refinery threatens 400 jobs.\nProject Willow, a \u00a31.5m feasibility study funded by the UK and Scottish governments, looks at potential low-carbon alternative uses for the wider site.\nConsultants EY evaluated 300 technologies - and came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.\nThis involves breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics such as clingfilm-type products to produce naptha and pyrolysis oil vapour.\nCurrently these plastics are usually incinerated or go to landfill.\nThey could instead be reused in plastics production or refined as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.\nIt would require about \u00a3150m-\u00a3250m of capital investment, create 35-60 jobs and operations could start before the end of 2028\nThis uses chemicals to dissolve waste plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene.\nThe material can then be reused to create new plastic products or packaging.\nBetween 35 and 45 jobs could be created, with operations commencing late in 2028.\nA relatively low amount of capital investment of \u00a325m-\u00a330m would be required.\nSuch technology could make use of plastic derived from bottle deposit return schemes when they are introduced across the UK.\nWaste and by-products from sectors like food, drink, packaging and agriculture could be fermented using bacteria.\nThis could produce low-carbon chemical products such as acetone, butanol or ethanol.\nRaw materials are plentiful - the amount of paper and cardboard waste currently produced in the UK is about 50 times the capacity of the plant being proposed for Grangemouth.\nEY believes 80-100 jobs could be created through \u00a3215m-\u00a3265m of capital investment, with operations starting in 2030.\nSustainably-sourced Scottish timber and timber waste could be broken down and fermented to produce bioethanol.\nThis is used in fuel blending, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.\nThis option would compliment plans to scale up the amount of softwood production through forestry in Scotland.\nBetween 50 and 60 jobs would be created from \u00a3350m-\u00a3430m of investment with production starting in 2032.\nAnaerobic digestion is already carried out at dozens of small-scale plants across Scotland.\nThe process takes animal waste and sewage sludge and ferments it into biomethane.\nThe gas can then be used by local industry or injected into the gas grid.\nAlthough burning it releases carbon dioxide, it is considered carbon neutral because the carbon originates from the atmosphere rather than underground.\nThe report says an investment of \u00a315m-\u00a325m would create 5 -10 jobs by 2028.\nFats, oils and certain crops potentially grown in Scotland can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.\nThe process would require hydrogen - but that could be produced sustainably.\nChina is currently investing heavily in this kind of fat and oil conversion technology, so an adequate supply of raw materials from Scotland would have to be secured.\nThis would come in part from used cooking oil, tallow and fish oil but would need to be supplemented by oil seed crop production.\nIt would require hefty investment, from \u00a3740m-\u00a3900m, but would also save a lot of carbon emissions and support 90-120 jobs. Production could start by 2032.\nHydrogen can be produced from water using a process called electrolysis. It requires electricity but this could come from renewable sources provided it is cheap enough.\nLow-carbon hydrogen could then be used as a replacement for natural gas in industrial processes.\nThe reports says the UK government should reform the energy market to reduce the cost of renewable electricity to industrial consumers, making green hydrogen production more commercially attractive.\nAbout 25-30 jobs would be created by late 2030 with \u00a3210m-\u00a3250m of investment required.\nIf enough low-carbon hydrogen is produced at a reasonable cost, this could in turn be used to make methanol - which can be converted to aviation fuel.\nGrangemouth is already a supplier of far less environmentally-friendly jet fuels to Scottish airports.\nSuch manufacturing facilities could create between 240 and 270 jobs but it would be 2036 before production gets under way.\nThis option would also require around \u00a32bn of new investment in the site.\nAnother potential use of low-carbon hydrogen is to turn it into ammonia.\nThis could be used to decarbonise shipping, as ammonia-powered engine technology develops, and it is also used by the chemicals industry.\nAs with e-methanol production, it requires electricity to be cheap enough to make the large-scale production of green hydrogen more commercially viable.\nThe amount of hydrogen required is so large that so-called \"blue hydrogen\" could also be necessary, produced from natural gas with the carbon dioxide by-product piped to north-east Scotland to be buried underground.\nThe proposed Project Acorn carbon capture scheme at Peterhead missed out on a first round of UK funding but an update on support is expected this summer.\nEY estimates it would take a decade or more before e-ammonia production would start but between 180 and 210 jobs would eventually be created and there would be significant emissions benefits.",

        "text": "People in Skegness have described being \"moved to tears\" after debris was found on a large stretch of the beach following a crash involving two ships.\nThe impact between an oil tanker and cargo vessel Solong in the North Sea, off East Yorkshire, on 10 March, triggered an explosion and fires, which have been extinguished.\nOne crew member of the Solong, a Filipino national, is missing and presumed dead. The Russian captain of the cargo vessel has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter.\nThe owners of the cargo ship admitted tiny plastic pellets, held in containers on board, had been released. The coastguard said they were being removed from the beaches in Lincolnshire and Norfolk.\nJohn Byford, a photographer who lives in Skegness, said: \"I was very upset to see it. This beach is my home.\n\"I often complain about litter, but this is much more serious.\"\nMr Byford said the debris was strewn along a large stretch of the beach and also in the vicinity of the Gibraltar Point Nature Reserve.\n\"It's going to have a big impact, but we can all work together to clean up the beach,\" he said.\nKyle Campbell, who was out walking his dog earlier on Wednesday, said stumbling on the debris had been \"really distressing\".\n\"I've never seen anything like this before, it broke my heart,\" he said.\n\"We see on TV this accident and we don't really think it's going to have an impact.\n\"I kayak on the sea, I swim in the sea and it's like this has been ruined.\"\nChief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said a \"counter pollution retrieval operation\" was ongoing after small balls of plastic resin, known as nurdles, were sighted off The Wash and along the Norfolk shore between Old Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea.\nConservation groups have said the nurdles, which are not toxic, can have a devastating impact on animals, including seals, puffins and fish, if they are eaten.\nTammy Smalley, from the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, said they had been made aware of the incident late on Tuesday.\n\"I'm born and bred in Skegness. I actually shed a tear last night when I saw the pictures coming through,\" she said.\nIn addition to nurdles, Ms Smalley said there had also been several reports of dead birds.\n\"Unfortunately, the risks posed by nurdles increase when other pollutants become stuck to them,\" she said.\n\"We urge members of the public to report nurdle sightings, but to avoid touching them as they may have toxic pollutants stuck to them.\"\nPellets were previously spotted in The Wash, a large inlet of the North Sea which stretches from south of Skegness, in Lincolnshire, to near Hunstanton, in Norfolk.\nMr O'Callaghan said local authorities were \"leading the onshore response in both Norfolk and Lincolnshire\".\n\"Aerial surveillance flights are monitoring both vessels and the retrieval operation daily,\" he said.\nMr O'Callaghan said both the Stena Immaculate oil tanker and Solong remained stable and that salvage operations were continuing.\nFollowing the crash, 36 people - from both vessels - were rescued and taken safely to shore in Grimsby.\nOn Tuesday, Crowley, the Florida-based maritime operations company which was managing the tanker, posted a photo on social media showing 19 of the 23-strong crew members and praised their \"exceptional bravery\".\nThe photo had been taken in a restaurant in Grimsby on Friday, Crowley said.\nMark Angelo Pernia, 38, was named by the Crown Prosecution Service as the missing crew member.\nThe captain of the Solong, Vladimir Motin, 59, of Primorsky in St Petersburg, Russia, is charged with gross negligence manslaughter and is remanded in custody until 14 April when is due to appear before the Central Criminal Court in London.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

        "text": "Wildlife organisations have said it is a race against time to clear plastic pellets thought to have come from a collision involving two ships from beaches.\nThe pellets are thought to have entered UK waters when the Solong cargo ship struck the Stena Immaculate oil tanker off the coast of East Yorkshire on 10 March.\nThe coastguard said a \"retrieval operation\" was under way between Old Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea in Norfolk - as well as other parts of The Wash - where \"miles\" of the pellets, known as nurdles, have been found.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said it hoped lower tides in the coming days would help aid the recovery.\n\"We have a period of smaller tides \u2013 a small window of six or seven days \u2013 to get this operation under way and clear most of this stuff off our beaches,\" said Hayley Roan, from the RSPB in Norfolk.\n\"This is an internationally important area for birds and wildlife.\n\"This risk is birds might ingest some of this stuff, and the harm would be immense.\"\nNurdles are small lentil-sized pieces of plastic that are transported all over the world to create most plastic products.\nIt is feared millions of them entered the sea - some individually or moulded together - when the ships caught fire.\n\"Obviously, we don't want plastic pollution on the beach, but the nurdles can be tainted with other chemicals which can be directly toxic,\" said Nick Acheson, a conservationist and wildlife ambassador for the Norfolk Wildlife Trust.\n\"This is certainly a very bad time of year because it's when [birds such as] oyster catchers and ringed plovers are nesting on our beaches, and when hundreds of thousands of migrating birds are moving along our coast going back to their arctic breeding grounds.\n\"Our African migrants will also be arriving any time now.\"\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was notified by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution on Sunday after a \"sheen\" of nurdles was spotted in the sea off The Wash.\nAccording to the RSPB, The Wash supports more than 400,000 non-breeding waterbirds, the largest harbour seal colony in the UK, and is home to countless rare plants and invertebrates.\nMembers of the public have been warned not to touch the nurdles, and to instead alert the coastguard by calling 999.\nThe National Trust, which manages nature reserves on the North Norfolk coast, has advised dog owners to keep their pets on leads.\nThe coastguard said a nurdle \"retrieval operation\" was under way.\n\"Coastguard rescue teams and other specialist counter pollution assets have been sent to assist with this response,\" a statement added.\n\"Regular aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor both vessels and the retrieval operation.\"\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch is trying to establish the cause of the crash between the Solong and Stena Immaculate.\nAccording to the maritime operations company, Crowley, which was managing the tanker, 17,515 barrels of jet fuel were lost \"due to the impact and fire\" following the collision.\nCrowley said the nurdles did not come from the tanker.\nOne crew member, a Filipino national, of the Portuguese-flagged Solong is missing and presumed dead.\nThe Russian captain of the cargo vessel has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "text": "It is literally Emma Morris' job to keep the lights across Northern Ireland on.\nAs director of operations for SONI, Northern Ireland's electricity grid operator, she oversees the electricity network.\nBut she wants more young women to follow in her footsteps.\nEmma Morris is one of the few women in leadership positions in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in Northern Ireland.\nAccording to the Department for the Economy's (DfE) women in STEM taskforce, only one in five STEM jobs are filled by women.\nEmma Morris took A-levels in maths, physics and chemistry before studying electrical and electronic engineering at Queen's University Belfast (QUB).\n\"We've made real progress in recent years but it's still very much a male dominated profession,\" she told BBC News NI.\nShe said at QUB, while there were \"around 120 people in my class, four of us were girls\".\nBut the \"gender gap\" between girls and boys studying STEM subjects starts earlier, at school.\nIn 2024, while maths and physics were among the most popular subjects studied at A-level by boys they were not in the top five most popular subjects taken by girls.\nDuring Engineers Week, which took place earlier in March, Emma Morris and SONI hosted pupils from Lagan College in Belfast with the aim of encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers.\n\"There maybe is that perception, traditionally, that engineering in particular, and other STEM subjects, are more male-oriented careers,\" Emma Morris said.\n\"Engineering is about so much more than that, and I don't know why females don't flock to the STEM subjects.\"\nCivil engineer Clare Morris also came to SONI to meet the pupils.\nShe is an associate director at a large civil engineering consultancy in Belfast called McAdam Design.\nShe helped to create Engineers Week to raise awareness of careers in engineering.\n\"We've engaged over 2,000 children across Northern Ireland this year in the roles of engineering, in hands-on activities,\" she said.\nClare Morris recognised what she described as \"the disparity\" between men and women studying engineering when she was one of only seven women in a class of over 150 studying civil engineering at university.\n\"Whilst the number of women in engineering is increasing, it's not increasing at a rate where we're seeing it reflected in those graduate or middle management or senior management roles,\" she said.\nClare Morris said that stereotypes around engineering and other STEM careers needed to be tackled.\n\"There's that misconception that engineering is about physical labour, hard hats, muddy boots and construction,\" she said.\n\"When really at the core of engineering it's about communication, creativity, innovation and teamwork.\"\nThe message was certainly getting through to Lagan College pupils Lauren and Eva, who are studying STEM subjects.\n\"In the past they've been very known to be boys' subjects or subjects that boys predominantly would have done,\" Lauren told BBC News NI.\n\"Knowing that not many girls do it or thinking 'am I going to be the only girl in the class?' would make you not want to go on to study it.\"\nBut Lauren is now looking at a future career as an engineer.\n\"Once women and girls start coming in then other younger girls will feel more confident.\n\"That's how it will grow.\"\nEva, meanwhile, is considering mechanical or electrical engineering as a future career.\n\"Men and women, obviously their brain power is basically the same so I think more women should definitely be encouraged to go into more STEM subjects,\" she said.\n\"You should really just follow what you are best at, so if you think that you are going to be good at those subjects you should definitely go for it and shouldn't worry about what other people are going to think or say.\"\nFor SONI's Emma Morris, it is about getting girls interested in STEM at a young age.\n\"It's really about getting to people when they're young, and trying to do away with the stereotypes, you know, that this is for men,\" she said.\n\"Because it's not.\"",

        "text": "Voting, enjoying Christmas dinner and keeping fit in zero gravity - that's just some of what has kept Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams busy during their prolonged stay on the International Space Station (ISS).\nAfter nine months, the pair are finally making their way home in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.\nSo what has life been like for the Nasa astronauts orbiting 250 miles (400km) above us, and how have they passed the time?\nOf course there was a lot of serious space stuff to keep them occupied.\nSuni, 59, and Butch, 62, have been helping ongoing missions at the station with maintenance and experiments, and have conducted spacewalks.\nSuni ventured outside in mid-January with fellow astronaut Nick Hague to perform repairs on the craft. She and Butch went out together later in the month.\nTheir tasks included repairing equipment that governs station orientation, adding light filters on the NICER X-ray telescope, and replacing a reflector device on an international docking adapter.\nButch and Suni have taken the situation in their stride, saying in a news conference in September that they have been trained to \"expect the unexpected\".\nThey have definitely had opportunities for reflection about life back home - and for watching a lot of sunrises and sunsets.\nAs the space station makes 16 orbits of Earth every 24 hours, it travels through 16 sunrises and sunsets, treating those on board to a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes.\nLiving with such a unique view of the Earth gives plenty of room for contemplating it, something Suni has acknowledged.\n\"It opens up the door to making you think a bit differently. It's the one planet we have and we should be taking care of it,\" she said.\n\"There are so many people on Earth sending us messages it makes you feel right at home with everybody.\"\nButch and Suni and the two other Americans who were on board with them, Don Pettit and Nick Hague, each had the opportunity to vote in last year's US election.\n\"It's a very important duty that we have as citizens,\" Suni said to reporters.\nButch said Nasa had made it \"very easy\" for them to be included in elections.\nTo facilitate their voting, the Mission Control Center in Houston sent ballot papers via encrypted email to the ISS.\nThe astronauts then filled them out and transmitted them to satellites which relayed them to a ground terminal in New Mexico.\nFrom there, landlines transmitted the ballots to Mission Control, who then electronically sent them to the astronauts' county clerks for filing.\nFor Butch, the day starts at 04:30, and as for Suni, she makes a slightly kinder 06:30 start.\nBoth have said they enjoy the two hours or more of exercise they must do daily to combat the loss of bone density from living in space.\n\"Your joints don't hurt, which is quite nice,\" Butch has said.\nThree different machines help to counter the effect of living in zero gravity.\nThe Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is used for squats, deadlifts, and rows that work all the muscle groups. For treadmills crews must strap in to stop themselves floating away, and there is also a cycle ergometer for endurance training.\nAt Christmas, astronauts on the International Space Station posted a festive message in which they wished their friends and family on Earth a merry Christmas.\nThe team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers, throwing the slowly gyrating microphone to each other to speak while candy canes floated around their heads.\nIt was a chance for the crew to let their hair down, though in Suni's case it was more a case of letting it 'up'.

And I'm not a fan of getting wet!\n\"This boat will make a huge difference when we need to get to them fast, and will hopefully see even more cubs saved each year.\"\nThe charity, which started out as a hut in founder Dave Webb's garden, was founded in 1998, and became an officially registered charity in 2016.\nThe rehabilitation centre is now set in two acres with 19 enclosures, two cub rooms, a cub hospital and treatment room.\nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

        "text": "When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected.\nAfter all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not effected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place.\nHowever, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain.\n\"We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,\" she says.\n\"It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.\"\nTheir final insurance bill was around \u00a345,000.\nShe says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.\nAlthough she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. \"We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.\n\"We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.\"\nClimate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes.\nWhile it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk.\nLast December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future\u202fflood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England.\nIt used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office.\nIt also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.\nThe new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.\n\"We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,\" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.\n\"When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.\"\nThe Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk.\nSimilar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.\n\"We can no longer rely on historical data,\" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.\nThe London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios.\nIt combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.\n\"While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,\" he says.\n\"Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.\"\nWhile banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.\n\"They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,\" says Mr Ahmed.\nMany parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.\nIn the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.\nTo help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings.\n\"We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,\" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.\n\"We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,\" he adds.\nFaura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.\n\"Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,\" says Mr Holmes.\nOther services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.\n\"If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],\" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.\nAs for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.\n\"Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,\" she advises.\n\"Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety.\"",

It all adds to our data of bird movement around the country.\n\"The data that my group collects is fed into the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) databank called DeMon, and researchers and scientists can access this for their studies.\n\"The bird we ringed at Courteenhall was one of approximately 226 goldfinches we caught that day so they are all out there somewhere and, if they get captured elsewhere or sadly found dead, the specific number on the ring on the leg of the bird gives us all the information.\"\nRosie Davis, estate manager at Courteenhall, added: \"It was very exciting to hear that one of our birds had flown all the way to Ireland.\n\"We're looking forward to seeing if he flies back to us.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

And of course, it's within its rights to decide what it supports and to what extent,\" Dr Tedros said.\n\"But the US also has a responsibility to ensure that if it withdraws direct funding for countries, it's done in an orderly and humane way that allows them to find alternative sources of funding.\nAn estimated 25 million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which is more than two-thirds of the global total 38 million people living with the disease.\nIn Nigeria, nearly two million people are living with HIV, with many relying on receiving aid-funded medicines.\nKenya has the seventh-largest number of people living with HIV in the world, at around 1.4 million, according to WHO data.\n\"We ask the US to reconsider its support for global health, which not only saves lives around the world, it also makes the US safer by preventing outbreaks from spreading internationally,\" Dr Tedros said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Within that area, Romania had the highest number of cases - 30,692 - followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147.\nThe WHO/Unicef statement concluded that measles remained \"a significant global threat\" and urged governments where cases were occurring to take quick action - and those where the virus had not arrived to be prepared to act.\nThere have been two deaths in the US recently as the disease - which was considered \"eliminated\" in the US in 2000 - spreads there and across Canada, too.\nFalling vaccination rates have been blamed for the recent flare-up.\nIn Europe, for instance, eight out of 10 people who were diagnosed with measles in the last year were not vaccinated, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\nEstimates from 2023 show that only four countries - Hungary, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia - had met the 95% threshold for vaccination to prevent an outbreak, the ECDC said on Tuesday.\nConcern has been expressed in the UK, too, over the spread of the disease, as vaccination rates for two doses have fallen below 90%.\nDr Ben Kasstan-Dabush of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine warned people against trusting unverified information on their social media.\n\"We also learnt from the Covid-19 vaccination programme that misinformation can travel rapidly and can influence people's decisions. It's important to be mindful that the vaccine information on social media may not be based on scientific evidence,\" Dr Kasstan-Dabush said.",

        "text": "The first daily pill for treating endometriosis symptoms has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales - but only for patients who have tried all other options.\nEndometriosis affects 1.5 million women in the UK, causing pain and extreme tiredness as a result of tissue similar to the womb lining growing elsewhere in the body.\nThe new tablet, known as relugolix combination therapy, has been approved by drug assessment body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and, unlike current injectable treatments, it can be taken at home.\nThe charity Endometriosis UK said the pill gives patients more choice, but will help only a relatively small number of people.\nThe new combination therapy pill will cost \u00a372 for a 28-day supply, NICE said.\nIt works by blocking specific hormones that contribute to the condition, while also providing replacement hormones that are needed.\nIt will only be available on the NHS for people who have already tried all other medical and surgical treatments and found they did not help, NICE said - equivalent to 1,000 women a year.\nThis includes treatments such as hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine delivery systems.\nHelen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said it marked \"a potential step-change in how we manage endometriosis, putting control back in patients' hands while ensuring value for the taxpayer\".\nShe said the treatment could be stopped and started more easily than other treatments, which is important for those planning to have children and for managing side effects.\nThat could also reduce pressure on NHS services, she added.\nNICE initially rejected the drug, but new evidence was provided by the manufacturer on its effectiveness and value for money.\nAmi Clarke, 27, from St. Albans, started experiencing endometriosis symptoms after her very first period, aged 13.\nShe was not diagnosed until 10 years later - by then she had tried six different contraceptive pills to find a way of helping her pain, but nothing seemed to work.\n\"I came off the pill and that's when my periods became absolutely, completely unmanageable. They took over my life. I wasn't going to university, I wasn't going to work,\" Ami says.\n\"If I was going to work, I was collapsing in pain consistently every single month.\"\nAmi kept going back to her GP because the pain was \"completely unbearable\".\n\"I was just so desperate, my mental health was on the floor. I don't even know how I survived. It was like 20 to 25 days out of the month where I was just completely bed-bound,\" she told the BBC.\nAmi had her first surgery in October 2021, which reduced the pain for seven or eight months, but then it gradually came back. A second operation in April 2024 was not as successful. She is now trying to raise enough money to have a third surgery, privately.\nAmi says it is good to hear that further treatment is being developed for endometriosis because \"a lot of the time it feels like you're being left in the dark\".\nUsually, the first treatments for endometriosis, after pain relievers, are hormone injections which temporarily shut down the body's production of estrogen. This is the hormone that causes endometriosis tissue to grow and cause pain.\nHowever, patients often need to travel to hospitals to have the injections, which last for up to three months.\nWith the new all-in-one tablet, there is no need for patients to remember to take hormone replacement therapy as a separate tablet.\nIt can be stopped quickly if side effects are difficult and taken up until the menopause.\n\"It's a step forward and will give patients more choice, but it will impact a relatively small number of people,\" says Emma Cox, chief executive of Endometriosis UK.\n\"We need to see more investment in other research and treatments,\" she added.",

He had been recovering at home from surgery on a brain blood clot earlier that month.\nProsecutors allege that Maradona's death could have been avoided and accuse the hospital staff of medical negligence.\nThe defendants say Maradona had refused further treatment and should have stayed in hospital for longer after his operation.\nThey risk prison terms between eight and 25 years if convicted on the charge of \"homicide with possible intent\".\nIn an opening statement, the prosecution said it intended to submit \"solid\" evidence that no member of the team \"did what they were supposed to do\" in the \"horror theatre\" that was Maradona's death bed.\n\"Today, Diego Armando Maradona, his children, his relatives, those closest to him, and the Argentine people, deserve justice,\" prosecutor Patricio Ferrari told the court.\nInvestigators have classified the case as culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter, because they said the accused were aware of the seriousness of Maradona's health condition but did not take the necessary measures to save him.\nThe defendants in the case are a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a medical co-ordinator, a nursing co-ordinator, a doctor and the night nurse.\nThe night nurse previously said he had seen \"warning signs\", but had received orders \"not to wake\" Maradona.\nMore than 100 witnesses will testify at the trial, which is expected to last until July.\nDiego Maradona is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game. He was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous \"Hand of God\" goal against England in the quarter-finals.\nDuring the second half of his career, Maradona struggled with cocaine addiction and was banned for 15 months after testing positive for the drug in 1991.\nThe news of his death threw the football world - and his home country of Argentina - into deep mourning, with many thousands of people queuing for hours to walk by his coffin at the presidential palace in Buenos Aires.",

        "text": "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.\nThe flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.\nThe software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.\nMedefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.\nThe flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.\nIn late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"\nMedefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.\nHowever, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.\nThe software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.\n\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"\nThe problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.\nThe engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.\nHe said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.\n\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.\nOn discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.\nMedefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.\nIt says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".\nMedefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.\nThe engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.\nIn a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"\nHe confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.\n\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"\nThe security agency will complete its review later this week.\nDr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"\nCybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.\n\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.\n\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.\nAnother expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.\n\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.\nMedefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.\nIn a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.\n\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\"",

        "text": "Online pharmacies will now have to employ stricter checks to stop people who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders buying weight-loss jabs.\nThey will no longer be able to dispense the medication, sold under brand names such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to patients who have just completed online questionnaires or sent photos.\nIn-person or video consultations will be required, to verify patient body mass index (BMI), along with information from GP or medical records.\nAnd pharmacists failing to follow this new guidance could face enforcement action, including fitness-to-practise investigations or inspections, and conditions such as improvement plans, the General Pharmaceutical Council says.\nThe GPhC is worried about about both unsafe prescribing and potential supply issues, with some online pharmacies reportedly setting targets to process a certain number of prescriptions per hour.\nAnd prescribers will be told to \"actively\" share with a patient's GP information about what they are dispensing.\nGPhC chief executive Duncan Rudkin said: \"We know online pharmacy services can provide a very valuable service - but through our inspections and investigations, we've seen too many cases of medicines being supplied inappropriately online and putting people at risk.\"\nWeight-loss drugs are now classed as \"high risk\" medicines, requiring extra safeguards, and are offered on the NHS with very strict criteria.\nSemaglutide and tirzepatide were first used to help type 2 diabetes patients regulate their blood-sugar levels.\nBut in the past three to four years, they started being prescribed as a weight-loss aide, leading to global shortages and counterfeit products.\nBoth are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.\nAnd patients generally start on a low dose, which is gradually increased.\nThe drugs mimic the intestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is released after eating and typically makes people feel fuller.\nTirzepatide (Mounjaro) also affects the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) hormone, which controls metabolism and helps regulate energy balance.\nThe first study into weight-loss drugs has found they can significantly improve heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure.",

        "text": "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.\nThe NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.\nHowever, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.\nThe Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.\nBV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.\nThe colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.\nHalf of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.\nBacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.\nIt can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.\nIn the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.\nThe doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.\nOne of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.\n\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.\nIn the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.\nGiven the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.\nThe British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".\n\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.\nIf you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic.",

        "text": "Last month, a school teacher in the western Indian city of Pune found her six-year-old son upset about homework.\n\"I had erased some words and asked him to write them. I assumed he was angry and that's why he was not holding the pencil properly,\" she told the Indian Express newspaper.\nShe never imagined his struggle to hold a pencil was the first sign of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.\nWithin days, the boy was in intensive care, unable to move his arms or legs. As his condition worsened, he lost the ability to swallow, speak, and eventually breathe, requiring ventilator support. He is now recovering.\nThe boy is among around 160 reported cases of GBS since early January in Pune, an education and IT hub, ringed by industrial towns and villages. There have been five suspected deaths. Currently, 48 patients are in intensive care, 21 on ventilator, and 38 have been discharged, according to official figures.\nGBS begins with tingling or numbness in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. Symptoms worsen over two to four weeks, typically starting in the arms and legs. The reported mortality rate varies between three and 13%, depending on severity and quality of health care support.\nThe outbreak in Pune is being traced to a pathogen called campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of foodborne infections, and the biggest driver of GBS worldwide. The link between the two was discovered in the 1990s in rural China, where the pathogen was common in chickens, and GBS outbreaks occurred every monsoon as children played in water contaminated by chicken or duck droppings.\nGBS is not entirely uncommon in India. Monojit Debnath and Madhu Nagappa, of Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), studied 150 GBS patients over a five year period between 2014 and 2019.\nTheir findings showed 79% of the patients had evidence of prior infections, with a third testing positive for campylobacter. Notably, co-infections were more common, occurring in 65%, suggesting a complex interplay of bacteria and viruses.\nMore recently, outbreaks linked to the pathogen have been reported from all over the world. In the first seven months of 2023, Peru reported over 200 suspected cases and at least four deaths of GBS, prompting the government to declare a national health emergency and strengthen public health measures. Two-thirds of the cases were linked to campylobacter.\nIn countries with good hygiene, fewer GBS cases are linked to campylobacter, with respiratory infections being a major contributor, say experts. There have been other triggers as well. In 2015 Brazil reported a cluster of GBS cases linked to the Zika virus. Vaccines can rarely trigger GBS, but one Covid vaccine was reportedly linked to a few hundred GBS cases in the UK in 2021.\n\"Campylobacter is endemic with hundreds of thousands of cases taking place all the time. It is always existing in the environment,\" Hugh Willison, a professor of neurology at University of Glasgow told me.\nYet, it is not easy to develop GBS, scientists say.\nThere's a specific strain of campylobacter, which has a sugar-coated outer layer, and in rare cases, its molecular structure matches the coating of human nerve cells.\nWhen the patient's immune system attacks the bacteria, it may end up targeting the nerves as well \u2013 a process called molecular mimicry \u2013 leading to GBS. However, a small fraction of campylobacter strains have this nerve-like coat.\n\"In Pune, a strain of campylobacter with this molecular feature is likely to be circulating, and a surge in infections with this strain consequently leads to a higher number of GBS cases,\" says Prof Willison.\nMost experts estimate that about one in 100 campylobacter strains carry the GBS risk, and one in 100 people infected with such a strain develop GBS, making the overall risk roughly one in 10,000.\nThat creates what Prof Willison describes as an \"immunological Russian roulette\", triggering an \"acute neurological tsunami\" that surges through the peripheral nervous system. Once the immune response subsides, the attack wanes \u2013 but the body still needs time, medical care, and support to repair the damage.\nWhat makes things worse is that there is no cure for GBS.\nIn GBS, the body produces antibodies against campylobacter, which then attack the nerves. Physicians use \"plasma exchange\", a process that filters blood to remove the harmful antibodies, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic antibody derived from normal blood, to help reduce the severity of the disease.\nThe other challenge is that there is no single test to diagnose GBS. The diagnosis, say physicians, is mainly based on clinical features. It presents itself as a form of paralysis which can be also caused by polio, viruses or rare neurological disease.\n\"The diagnosis is a constellation of clinical features. Misdiagnosis or no diagnosis or late diagnosis can happen easily,\" says Prof Willison.\nIndia's uneven public health system presents a challenge, as doctors in rural areas may struggle to diagnose GBS. One reason, possibly, why the World Health Organization (WHO) teams are in Pune, is collaborating with federal and state health workers to trace, test, and monitor cases, and analysing trends to support effective treatment.\nAuthorities say they have surveilled more than 60,000 houses, picked up 160 water samples for tests, and asked people to drink boiled water and eat fresh and clean food, and not have \"stale food and partially cooked chicken or mutton\".\nWhile most cases of GBS around the world come from undercooked poultry, it can also spread through water, similar to cholera or salmonella, experts say.\nContaminated water used for washing or preparing street food makes it easy for the bacteria to spread. Clearly, in Pune, a campylobacter strain with the distinctive molecular feature is circulating, affecting a large number of people.\nWhat is not clear is whether this has been due to large scale contamination of water supply or a lot of people consuming infected poultry. \"We appeal to people not to panic,\" says a health department advisory. But in the face of uncertainty, it is easier said than done.",

        "text": "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.\nRicky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.\nBBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).\nOne woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.\nSeveral local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.\nOur undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.\nHe also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.\nPosing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.\nDespite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.\nWithin five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.\nBy the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.\nWe did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.\nReviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.\n\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"\nThe filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.\nMr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.\nOne of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.\nHaving had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.\nAll she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".\nBut when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.\nShe had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.\nIn the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.\n\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"\nShe was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.\nAfter counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.\nAs he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.\n\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"\nBy the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"\nShe says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.\n\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"\nBy this point, sepsis had begun to set in.\n\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"\nIn hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.\nAfter messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.\nFortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.\nAnother of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.\nFour days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.\nShe rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"\nLouise had developed sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.\nJanet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.\n\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.\nHowever, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.\nJanet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.\nA prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.\nBBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.\nFrom a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.\nInjecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.\nIn September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.\nFollowing her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).\nSave Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.\nAll the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.\n\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"\nSo far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council - confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.\nBut \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.\nWe put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".\nIt said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".\nWe attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.\nAs soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.\nWe asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.\n\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.\nThe dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.\n\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"\nIt is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: \"People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.\"\nIf you have information about this story and would like to share your experiences please contact shona.elliott@bbc.co.uk directly or use the form below.

        "text": "King Charles III has learned about groundbreaking research into cancer therapies as part of a second day of engagements in Northern Ireland.\nThe King was visiting Ulster University's campus in Coleraine where he was told about stimulus-responsive therapeutic technology that is being used to target tumours.\nHe looked at some of the microbubbles, used to deliver therapies, through a microscope before meeting those who had underwent cancer treatment and unveiling a plaque marking his visit.\nBoth the King and the Princess of Wales, were treated for cancer last year.\nCatherine announced in January that she is in remission, and King Charles is having ongoing treatment.\nIvan McMinn, chair of the Northern Ireland Pancreatic Cancer charity, said meeting the King was a \"privilege\".\nMr McMinn was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 14 years ago, and has been in remission for 10 years.\n\"You can just see he is genuinely interested in the combination of research and government departments working with people with lived experience, and the magic sauce to bring all that together for the betterment of patients across all cancers,\" he told the PA News Agency.\nThe King and Queen Camilla started their second day in Northern Ireland in the north west, where they were welcomed by members of the local community in Market Street, Limavady.\nYoung and old lined the streets to wave Union flags and cheered as the royal couple arrived.\nAmong the crowd was six-year-old cocker spaniel Lily, whose owner Nadine Connor dressed her in a knitted crown for the occasion.\nLily was wearing a handmade, knitted crown and Union Jack harness for the occasion and has \"never had as much attention\", according to her owner.\nMs Connor described the meeting as a \"blur\" with the King and Queen taking \"great amusement\" in the dog's appearance.\n\"The King is somebody that I have so much admiration for, for all the work that he does, and I think I was just all inspired,\" she told BBC Foyle's North West Today programme.\n\"It was just absolutely lovely to be so close to him and shake his hand. It meant a lot, I have to say.\"\nThe royal couple's tour of the town included a visit to a local business, Hunters Bakery, which is 200 years old.\nInside, the King and Queen met long-serving staff, some of which have worked there for 40 years, and were also treated to a demonstration of how to make Ulster Scots crumpets.\nThey both took turns at flipping crumpets.\nThe couple also cut a cake to mark the 200th anniversary of the business, with both ensuring they had a taste before saying their farewells.\nThe King and Queen then took a brief walk along Market Street.\nThey then moved to Roe Valley Arts and Culture Centre, where they viewed a presentation of arts, including glass work, photography, a willow artist and ceramicist.\nHosted by Leona Kane, the King and Queen then undertook a short tour of Broighter Gold.\nBroighter Gold was established 14 years ago and is now one of the UK's best-known rapeseed oil suppliers.\nThe business is named after the Broighter 'Hoard of gold', which was discovered on their land in 1896.\nThey then moved to Roe Valley Arts and Culture Centre, where they viewed a presentation of arts, including glass work, photography, a willow artist and ceramicist.\nAmong those the couple met was award-winning photographer Cathal McNaughton, who showed King and Queen a picture he took of the late Queen Elizabeth II holding an umbrella at the opening of the Lawn Tennis Association's headquarters in London when he worked for the Press Association.\nThe King appeared visibly pleased to see the photograph of his late mother.\nWillow artist Louise McLean, who worked on the Windsor Garden arches for the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation, said she spoke to the King about the making of woven bee skeps.\nMs McLean said the King and Queen kept engaging in the conversation about her work.\n\"It was so lovely, I have to say they were much more personable and down-to-earth than I could ever have imagined,\" she said.\nOutside the centre, the couple watched the Conductology Orchestra, made up of musicians with and without additional needs, who performed a rendition of Danny Boy.\nThe royals then took part in another walkabout as well-wishers gathered outside the centre.\nThe King and Queen began their visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday, meeting musicians and artists in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter before travelling to south Belfast and Lisburn respectively.\nLater, King Charles held a private meeting with First and Deputy First Ministers Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly at Hillsborough Castle.",

She was seeing a psychologist once a week.\"\nHe added that Ms Nunn did not present as \"acutely suicidal\" at the time of the meeting, but the overdose was \"on the spectrum\" of self-harm.\nAsked if the overdose could have been an attempt to end her life, Dr Baker said: \"There is a distinction between deliberate self-harm and suicidal acts.\"\nThe inquest previously heard how Dr Baker had attended Ms Nunn's home with her care co-ordinator Ray McCullagh on 29 December, 2022, but no British Sign Language interpreter was in attendance.\nMs Nunn, known as Immy, had more than 780,000 followers on her social media accounts.\nThe inquest at West Sussex Coroner's Court in Horsham continues on Friday.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

        "text": "A new banking hub is set to be set up in a town that is losing its last remaining bank branch.\nThe UK's main cash machine network, Link, said on Wednesday that a hub would be brought to Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, following the announcement that Santander - the last bank with a high street presence in the town - would be closing 95 branches across the country.\nBanking hubs are shared spaces available to customers of any bank.\nHead of banking at Link, Donna Calero, said: \"We recognise that there is still a need for cash in Droitwich so that banking hub will be delivered within the next 12 months.\"\nBanking hubs are often set up in areas that are facing the loss of core cash services, like banks or cash machines, following an assessment by Link.\nThey are operated by the Post Office and funded by the UK's biggest banks, including Santander.\nAs chair of Droitwich Spa Place Board, Matt Nicol has been calling for a banking hub in the town for several years.\nHe said Droitwich Spa was home to large numbers of elderly people who relied on in-person banking.\n\"Droitwich went from having a number of banks to having one in a very short space of time,\" Mr Nicol explained. \"And what they didn't allow for is preparing the local community for what digital banking looks like. There's a generation that hasn't had that opportunity.\"\nHe said businesses had also struggled.\n\"Businesses were closing for a couple of hours to go and do their money drop-off, having to drive to another city \u2013 Worcester \u2013 to make their payments, and it took two hours of their day.\n\"So the banking hub's going to solve a lot of problems for a lot of people.\"\nMs Calero said the new banking hub would host community bankers - representatives from the country's biggest banks who each visit one day a week to see customers in person.\nMr Nicol said the response from people in Droitwich Spa to news of the hub had been \"overwhelming\".\n\"If you need to do something face-to-face, if you've got a problem with a PIN code or something like that, you can go and see someone instead of having to sit on a phone to someone for 20, 25 minutes,\" he said.\n\"I don't think you'll see\u2026 towns having numerous banks any more. I think it's going to end up looking more like banking hubs going forward.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "text": "When her relationship broke down at the age of 27, Tanya started drinking. It began a downward spiral of drug and alcohol addiction that took 15 years for her to escape.\nShe took to street drinking, and begging outside supermarkets. Her house became a squat and her young daughter was brought up by the child's grandmother.\nNow 45, Tanya, from Cambridge, says she has never been happier thanks to her own willpower, and help from a family support project funded by Comic Relief. She has been in recovery for seven years and has another child, a young daughter.\n\"I'm so lucky to have a second chance because most of the people I knew back then have passed away. I'm so grateful I survived it,\" she said.\nShe says the break up of her family was a trigger.\n\"I started drinking alone which I'd never done before, and it got worse from there,\" she said.\n\"I was hanging on for dear life, trying to do the school runs, but I was failing miserably. My daughter went to live with my mum and I pretty much stayed away. I didn't want to bring my chaos into her world,\" said Tanya.\nThings took a turn for the worse when Tanya started using crack and heroin. Her home was often full of fellow drinkers, smoking and injecting drugs.\nShe was drinking heavily on the streets, started begging and spent time in prison.\n\"It's like my whole life disappeared, the person I was disappeared. I still remember the first time I begged, and I was just so embarrassed.\"\nTowards the end of her addiction Tanya was desperate to get clean and move away from the house that was supposed to be her family home.\nIn 2018, she downsized to a small flat and the council paid her \u00a31,400 as an incentive.\n\"There was a poignant moment as I sat in my new flat. I had \u00a31,400 in my account that I wasn't used to, and I could clearly see two roads in front of me. I could go and score, use all the money like I always had done, or do something different,\" she said.\n\"The next day I went out with my bank card and spent the whole lot on paints, a new sofa, curtains... everything I needed for my lovely new flat. I left myself without a penny - on purpose - and I have never used since.\"\nIt was the start of her recovery as she weaned off drugs with controlled medication, but she said the next few years to becoming completely clean were tough.\nWhen Tanya fell pregnant for the second time, she started visiting the King's Hedges Family Support Project in Cambridge which receives funding from Comic Relief.\nOn that first visit, at nine months pregnant, the first person she met was support worker Karen Doherty.\n\"She was very nervous, but Tanya is good at expressing how she feels and we hit it off straightaway,\" said Karen.\n\"To see who she is now, the person she's become, and the wonderful mother she is makes me feel really proud.\"\nThe project is 30 years old this year and, according to manager Suzi Buttress, its work and the Comic Relief funding has never been more vital.\n\"We don't like to harp back to the pandemic, but it had a massive impact on children,\" she said.\n\"Children who were born in that period were in lockdown. And now we've gone from that to a cost of living crisis, so for many families it's about food, fuel and basic needs.\n\"As a small charity, it's harder and harder to find money, so we really appreciate the support we get from Comic Relief.\"\nFor Tanya, the future is bright. She is in touch with her eldest daughter, now in her 20s, who now has a little sister.\nTanya still keeps a few old photographs of herself, but the person she became when life took a wrong turn has gone.\n\"I recognise her - I remember her - but I'm not her now,\" she said.\nDetails of help and support for addiction are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",

        "text": "Waiting times to get an ADHD diagnosis could get even longer if new budget limits are introduced, providers and charities have warned.\nNHS England is proposing to set payment limits on its \"right to choose\" providers, which GPs can refer patients to for an ADHD assessment anywhere in England.\nWhile the government said patients would \"continue to have the power to choose\", assessment organisations said the proposals were \"unworkable\" and could lead to delays.\nHartlepool mum Leanne Baister, who was considering using right to choose to assess her seven-year-old son for ADHD, said her family felt \"stuck\".\nThe NHS Choice Framework enables GPs to refer patients for specialist treatment, including ADHD or autism assessments, with any appropriate provider.\nThe costs are covered by the NHS.\nPatients sometimes choose providers outside of where they live because they may have shorter waiting times than those available in their own area.\nAt the moment, NHS Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) can be charged as much as necessary by providers.\n\"We are proposing to introduce a power for commissioners to limit payments for elective services, and other services reimbursed on an activity basis, above planned levels,\" a consultation notice from NHS England read.\nIt would apply to larger organisations, and the payment limit would be calculated based on previous levels of service and expectations for the coming year.\nThe government confirmed NHS England would continue to consult on the 2025/26 budget proposals, despite plans to eventually scrap the body.\nCEO of charity ADHD UK Henry Shelford, which aims to help people affected by the condition, said he expected waiting times to \"jump\".\n\"They want to make right to choose like getting an Oasis concert ticket,\" he said.\n\"You don't get what you think you're queuing up for, but instead of a wildly different price, it's a wildly different wait time than the one you expected.\"\nMr Shelford said that when the payment limit was reached, people would be forced to wait until the next year when funding was available again.\n\"It eradicates patient choice by making patient choice futile,\" he said.\nMany areas of the UK had such long backlogs for adult ADHD assessments that it would take at least eight years to clear them, a BBC investigation found last year.\nMrs Baister said she was considering using right to choose to get a quicker ADHD assessment for her son Toby.\nShe said the longer the wait, the longer it would take for them to access things like medication.\n\"This places our family under enormous pressures,\" Mrs Baister said. \"We're kind of stuck.\"\nShe works for charity Little SENDsations, which supports families of children with disabilities.\n\"Parents are burnt out and sick and tired of fighting a system full of brick walls,\" Mrs Baister said.\nMother-of-two Sarah Jane, from Hartlepool, waited five years for her own ADHD diagnosis.\nShe used right to choose to get an assessment for one of her own children and the waiting time was eight months.\nMs Jane said being officially diagnosed was \"validation\".\n\"If you don't know, and you've got all these feelings of 'something's wrong with me, I'm different', it affects your self-esteem.\"\nShe said it would be \"devastating\" if right to choose provider waiting times got longer.\n\"A lot of families are at breaking point,\" Ms Jane said. \"[Right to choose] gives people hope.\"\nADHD assessment providers are also apprehensive.\nPsicon managing director Dr Daniel Simmonds acknowledged the need for funding controls but said that current proposals appeared \"unworkable\".\n\"There is a risk that the pressures of implementation could unintentionally lead to delays in care, reduced capacity and compromised patient safety,\" he said.\nCo-founder and executive chair of Paloma Health, Darshak Shah, said proposals would risk right to choose being reduced to an \"illusion that exists 'in name only' - the right to be referred but not necessarily to be treated\".\nMeanwhile clinical director at Oakdale Dr Caroline Falcone said: \"As we interpret it, these limits could restrict the number of referrals we can accept from areas where we as a provider do not hold a direct contract with a patient's ICB.\n\"If funding does not align with the growing demand for ADHD assessments, there is a risk that some individuals may struggle to access the services they need.\"\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the consultation did not propose any changes to the right to choose.\n\"This government inherited a broken NHS with too many patients facing long waits for ADHD assessment,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Through our Plan for Change, this government will get the NHS back on its feet by turning around severe delays and getting people the treatment they need.\"\nIt also added that it was working with NHS England's cross-sector ADHD taskforce to tackle the challenges those with ADHD face, including timely access to services and support.\nIn the proposal document for 2025/26, NHS England said setting payment limits was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"The proposal for commissioners to set payment limits is consistent with fixed allocations and the need for the NHS as a whole not to spend more than the resources it has available.\"\nA consultation on the payment proposals closed in February.\nNHS England has been contacted for comment.\nFollow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

This is her story.\nMy Mum, Janet Girsman, who lived in Esher, died in June 2020 at the age of 73.\nOver the years we talked about funeral arrangements, as she always had very specific wishes, The challenge was carrying out those wishes during the coronavirus pandemic.\nDue to the Covid restrictions the entire service had to be held outside by the graveside, and only 15 people were allowed at the service, including me.\nLike me, Mum was a journalist, starting as a magazine writer and eventually running her own PR agency. She travelled everywhere from Reykjavik to New York.\nOutside work, she loved tracing our family tree. She neither acted or looked her age.\nMy family is Jewish, but while we have our faith, we have never been particularly religious.\nSimilar to a funeral in \"normal\" times, I was able to choose some psalms to be recited, and the Rabbi officiating agreed to sing one of the pieces.\nSocial distancing was still in place which made the service really surreal.\nWhile it was lovely to see my family, it was odd not being able to touch or hug them at such a sad and intense time.\nWhen I was delivering the eulogy, people were getting really emotional and it was so hard not to instinctively reach out and hug them - or them me.\nOne crucial addition was that the service was being streamed or broadcast to those who couldn't be there in person.\nMum had many cousins and this meant they were able to see the funeral and participate online, from as far away as Australia.\nThere were also family watching in America and Denmark, as well as the UK.\nThat was one positive.\nThe fact that the funeral was broadcast internationally seemed fitting for a journalist who had travelled the world.\nIt meant that Mum's family could all pay their respects in a way we wouldn't have considered beforehand, and many who wouldn't have been able to attend usually, could be at the funeral virtually.\nThe wake afterwards was a further organisational headache.\nHere the Covid restrictions were a little more complex.\nI could have a total of six people inside, but outside was less restricted, provided everyone kept to social distancing.\nThank goodness Mum had a back garden. I know that not everyone had that luxury.\nIt was heartening to see quite a few friends and family.\nFive years on, looking back on Mum's death and the funeral, it still feels so strange - and tinged with the sadness of what could have been.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook and on X.

The global emergency has ended, the pandemic hasn't.\n\"People are still getting sick and never getting better.\"\nDr Ali has returned to work as a GP part-time but said she needed to rest in the afternoons because of chronic fatigue.\nShe said she was urging the government to recognise Covid as an occupational illness for healthcare workers.\nShe said: \"Around the country, a lot of long Covid clinics are being decommissioned as if we are still not here.\"\nShe said people who were the worst affected should get compensation.\nGP Ellie Mountstephens, 53, of Galmpton, Devon, said she contracted Covid at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\nAfter being off sick for six months, she lost her job as a partner in a GP practice.\nShe said she had not felt safe to go back to work as a GP because she struggled with her memory.\nShe said: \"I am really worried I will miss something key or I will forget to write something down. I don't trust myself to do a good job and I expect myself to do a good job for my patients.\"\nShe said she wanted the government to carry out more research into the condition.\nIn Cornwall, the Kernow Local Medical Committee - which represents Cornish general practice - said its pastoral service had supported \"a handful of GPs where long Covid seemed to be either a major contributor or causal factor responsible for their current work or personal problems\".\nIt added: \"We are also aware of a small number of patients working in the wider local health service for whom the condition has been career ending.\n\"In terms of the general population, we suspect that the majority of more susceptible individuals have now been challenged by the Covid virus: this, the vaccine, herd immunity, and the lack of testing have contributed to a slowing down of referrals and hopefully of serious new cases.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to ensuring there are quality services across the country for people suffering with long Covid, which we know can have a debilitating impact on people's physical and mental health.\n\"NHS England has rolled out a range of support for staff with long Covid and other conditions.\n\"No single treatment currently exists for the condition, which is why we are funding research into it.\n\"We are also joining up health and employment support so people with long term conditions can stay in work and get back into work.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.

She wasn't able to sleep properly.\"\nMr Carlier said after they had been told she had been \"mistakenly\" left off February's treatment list, the family were offered a date in April, which was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.\nDartford and Gravesham Trust said Mr Carlier's mother-in-law \"was not missed\" off the treatment list, but instead put on one at another hospital \"best suited\" to her needs.\nThe next appointment was set for September, but the NHS trust said this had been cancelled due to a \"clerical error\".\nMr Carlier said the family had to keep chasing the NHS to find out what was happening and eventually decided to pay for the surgery at a private clinic in October as she was in \"severe pain\".\n\"We could have waited, but she had suffered long enough,\" he said. \"It was all avoidable. It should have been done on the NHS long before that.\"\n\"They failed her,\" added his wife Louise.\nMr Carlier said his mother-in-law, whom he described as a \"vulnerable pensioner\", had been \"left out in the cold\" by the healthcare system.\n\"Whilst the intolerable agony is no longer there, the memories and experience of it have never gone away,\" he added, claiming she has been left with long-term physical and mental health impacts.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

That's my view.\"\nThe Rainbow Project, an LGBT campaign group in Northern Ireland, said: \"Everyone deserves the space and time to figure out who they are.\n\"And should be provided with all the support they need to do so.\"\nWhen asked if he was concerned that many members of the trans community would take offence with his opinions, Joshua insisted he was entitled to his opinion.\n\"I've already walked in their shoes,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"I've been down that path, and now I'm walking a new life with Jesus.\"\nIn February he had surgery to remove his breast implants and has stopped taking hormones.\nAs a teenager Joshua said he put pressure on his mother to allow him to go ahead with procedures to change his gender.\nShe has also supported him through the process of reversing the changes he had made to his body.\n\"As a mother she just wanted to love me,\" Joshua said.\n\"I think as a teenager, you think you know it all, and you really don't.\n\"I was partying\u2026 I was doing drugs\u2026 I was just doing crazy stuff.\"\nOn its website the Rainbow Project makes clear that how people approach the issue of transition is a personal subject.\nThey say: \"Some people decide that medical transition is the best thing for them \u2013 for others, it isn't a necessary part of the process.\n\"It all depends on how you feel about yourself and your body: only you can make the decision that is right for your life.\"\nThey also point out that it can be quite difficult accessing transgender healthcare in Northern Ireland.\nAsh Jones, who is a Green Party representative in Belfast and a trans woman, claims it is becoming more difficult for members of the trans community to access health care.\nAnd she argues that public debates about trans athletes and access to spaces like changing rooms has had a negative impact.\n\"I came out about eight years ago and honestly it is a much harder place to be trans now than it was then,\" she told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"We may be more visible but that visibility hasn't brought any real tangible benefits in terms of acceptance.\n\"In fact in terms of waiting lists it's so much worse than it used to be.\"\nShe added she is a \"much happier person\" after transitioning.\n\"Honestly, transitioning was probably life-saving for me given the mental anguish I was experiencing.\"\nNorthern Ireland's regional gender identity service in Belfast provides care and treatment to adults who are assessed as having gender dysphoria.\nPeople who use it can also access other services such as hormone treatment and mental health services, but those approved for gender reassignment must travel outside Northern Ireland because there is no surgical service here.\nChildren and young people experiencing gender dysphoria can avail of the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust's Knowing Our Identity Service which has a small number of staff with specialised skills.\nOnce a young person reaches the age of 17 and a half, arrangements can be made for them to move into adult services.\nHowever, there are long waiting times for assessment and treatment in adult services. The regional gender identity service in NI is currently seeing people referred to them in October 2017.\nThe move to ban puberty blockers came after a report into children's gender services - the Cass Review - said there were \"gaps in evidence\" around the drugs.\nIf you are impacted by any of the issues in this article details of help and support are available on the BBC Action Line.",

I believe it was between five and seven days of chemotherapy to get rid of her cells,\" said Ms Curtis.\nDolcie-Mae and her mother Courtney-Jade remain at the hospital while the rest of the family are in their hometown of Newport.\n\"On the seventh or eighth day she had the transplant with the donors cells.

She's got all the support she can have with her friends and family.\"\nMs Curtis also heaped praised on the doctors and nurses who have cared for Dolcie-Mae since she was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary.\nShe added: \"We appreciate every single thing they do.\"\nThe whole community has pulled together to support Dolcie-Mae, according to Ms Curtis.\n\"Until you go through something like this, you don't realise how close-knit the community is,\" she said.\nThe family were planning a fundraiser at the weekend to raise awareness about stem cell donation.\nIn a social media post the charity said that the mismatched stem cell transplant would \"be her best treatment option\" as there were no matches worldwide on the current register.",

        "text": "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.\nIn a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".\nHe said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".\nAt one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.\nHancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.\nHe defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.\nThe inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.\n\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.\n\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"\nThe former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.\nHancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".\nThe inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or other countries around the world.\n\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.\n\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"\nHe said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.\nHancock was later asked about a \u00a330m contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.\nEmails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".\nIn questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".\nHe said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".\nAt the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".\n\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added.",

        "text": "Debra Eichenbaum got her two young children vaccinated against the measles virus 20 years ago, and - like millions of other parents - hadn't thought about the highly contagious disease since.\nBut when cases across the US began to climb this year, the 62-year-old began to worry about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.\nSo she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.\n\"There's no downside to it,\" she said. \"For me, that was a no-brainer.\"\nMs Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.\n\"There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,\" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\nThe US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.\nThere have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly.\nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.\nThe federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.\nAsked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.\nMs Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose.\nThose vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\nThose who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.\nAdults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.\n\"The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nFor weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.\n\"It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,\" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.\nThe outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.\nThe measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say.\nIt is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.\nBut for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nMr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will \"100%\" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.\nChildren vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.\n\"There's no harm in getting the additional doses,\" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. \"The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.\"\nChildren can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.\n\"The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,\" Dr Ray said.\nParents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy.\nHowever, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.\nThe CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state.\nLocal health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.",

Two other people were known to be infected with listeria bacteria at the time of their death.\nThe bacteria was detected in a chocolate and vanilla mousse and a strawberry and vanilla mousse, both supplied by Cool Delight Desserts, UKHSA said - although it was not confirmed as the source of the infections.\nThe threshold of listeria found in the desserts was known to be below the legal threshold of what healthy people can tolerate, the PA news agency reported.\nThe Food Standards Agency said that the desserts were being removed from the supply chain as a precaution while investigations continue.\nThe five patients were aged between 68 and 89. All had underlying health conditions and were in hospital at the time of infection.\nTreated from May to December 2024, two were in Yorkshire and Humber, one in the North West of England, another in the West Midlands and one in Wales.\nListeriosis is a rare infection that is caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacteria. The outbreak was discovered as part of a routine surveillance in February 2025 at an NHS hospital in the South West.\nDr Gauri Godbole, deputy director for gastrointestinal infections, food safety and one health at the UK Health Security Agency said NHS Trusts and those providing care to vulnerable people had been advised to stop serving these desserts while investigations were under way.\nShe added that most people affected by listeriosis will have no symptoms or experience mild diarrhoea which subsides in a few days.\n\"Those who are more vulnerable like the severely immunocompromised or those with advanced aged can be at risk of severe illness such as meningitis and life-threatening sepsis.\"\nListeriosis in pregnancy can cause very serious illness in mothers and their babies, and in babies up to one month old.\nAccording to the NHS, listeria can contaminate a wide range of foods, but most infections are caused by eating chilled, ready-to-eat foods.\nThe BBC has contacted Cool Delight Desserts, which operates in Bury, and the NHS for comment.",

        "text": "A doctor who has played a vital role in shaping emergency trauma care in hospitals across the country and internationally has won a prestigious award.\nDr Rod Mackenzie, 57, is a senior consultant in emergency medicine and pre-hospital emergency medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.\nHe was awarded the 2025 Trauma Care Fellowship Award for his dedication to advancing trauma care as well as his leadership within system development and training across the UK and abroad for the past 30 years.\nDr Mackenzie said it was a \"real honour\" and \"humbling\" to join the other previous winners.\n\"It's in equal parts humbling and embarrassing in many respects,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I speak for all of us working in emergency medicine, we don't do what we do for a reward like that and we're often just getting on with things in the background.\"\nHe said medical teams \"like to squirrel away and get back to doing what we do\".\nDr Mackenzie stressed that the work he had been commended for was a \"team effort\" which could not have been achieved without his colleagues.\nThe award is bestowed by a board of trustees from Trauma Care UK and was established in 2020 to recognise \"exceptional contributions to trauma victim care\".\nDr Mackenzie has previously been described as the architect of the East of England Trauma Network - a small team that works with healthcare commissioners to monitor the effectiveness of major trauma centres and acute hospital trauma units.\nHe said he felt \"lucky\" to have influenced the design of this network which \"translates to saving lives and reducing suffering, and that's amazing\".\nDr Mackenzie reflecting on his work said it had been a \"privilege to help people who are at arguably their greatest time of need\".\n\"Helping people when they really need it is what's always driven me, I've always been involved in emergency healthcare and that is still central to everything I do,\" he added.\nHe stressed his work also ensured future patients were getting the best possible care.\nWhile the award is for lifetime achievement, Dr Mackenzie said he was not done with his work just yet.\n\"We're doing some amazing work both in terms of continuing to improve our systems and processes, but also some of the research work we're doing not just in terms of care but in terms of understanding how to prevent injury and prevent major trauma,\" he said.\n\"There's lots to do so I'm going to be around for a while.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "text": "After the first Covid lockdown was officially announced in 2020, \"things were changing on the hour, every hour\".\nNursing home manager Melanie Dawson has reflected on the impact of that time, five years on, and the lessons learned, alongside staff and residents at her care home.\nOn 23 March 2020, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to \"stay at home\" but at The Lawns home in Kempsey, Worcestershire, preparations were already under way.\nMs Dawson said she decided to close the care home to visitors two weeks before the national lockdown, on the weekend of Mothering Sunday.\n\"We get a tremendous amount of visitors into this home,\" she said.\n\"I spoke to Simon, our managing director, and took the decision to close The Lawns just because I could see it coming our way.\n\"Families were really grateful.\"\nMs Dawson said residents reacted with quiet resilience.\n\"Old people have their own thought process. They went back to their experience of the war and just sort of said, 'it'll all sort itself out'.\"\nHowever, behind the scenes, she admitted it was an intense time.\n\"We were testing people three or four times a week. With a staff team of 78, that's a massive amount,\" she said.\n\"You can't just isolate someone in their bedroom when the home is their bubble. These people were their family.\"\nFor lifestyle and wellbeing lead Joy, who worked throughout the pandemic, the lockdown was a time of great pressure.\n\"We were very lucky here - we didn't lose anybody - but that was through hard work, long hours and covering for people who couldn't come in,\" she said.\nHalf a decade on, the team now focus on \"living every day\".\n\"Smile every day, laugh every day,\" Joy added.\n\"Before we cleaned, obviously, but now we're much more conscious of infection control.\n\"Even now, if someone's got a cold, you're suddenly transported back five years.\"\nShe also remembered supporting residents at the end of their lives.\n\"They couldn't have their loved ones hold their hand, and that's where we stepped in,\" she added.\nMary, 86, a current resident of the home, was isolating with her husband at their house during the pandemic.\nShe had happy memories of lockdown as she said it gave them precious time together before he passed away.\n\"It was all right, really,\" she said.\n\"We just got on with it. Did the garden, walked up the hills. We had a bit of fun.\"\nShe missed seeing her family but said the phone kept them connected.\n\"It did affect me a bit but I knew it was temporary. And I had my husband. We had each other,\" Mary said.\nHe died not long after the pandemic, following a fall.\n\"We were near a hospital and they took him in. A lovely little boy brought me a cup of tea,\" she said.\n\"I sat and held [my husband's] hand till he died. It was terrible... but you've got to get up and carry on.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "text": "Five years on, Senior Sister Lauren Jakes still vividly remembers the moment she was told her ward was to expect the arrival of its very first Covid patient.\n\"You could see the fear in everybody's eyes,\" she says.\nAs the pandemic unfolded, the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital became a dedicated surge centre, taking seriously ill patients from across the East of England.\nSince then, SisterJakes says she has lost a \"very good number\" of nurses to other departments, as they could no longer face working in critical care.\nSister Jakes recounted how there was a reluctance to enter the room of the first Covid patient, until one of the other sisters set the example for how they would need to tackle the disease head-on.\nThe experienced nurse described the first two years as \"terrifying\", with the unit caring for double its usual number of patients.\nStaff were drafted in from other departments, with nurses responsible for four patients, instead of one.\nSister Jakes said she \"cried\" the first time she heard people clapping for the NHS.\nShe said she still saw the faces of patients and would never forget some of the people she came across.\n\"I have put the memories of that time in a little box, deep within my brain.\n\"Will it ever be opened again? I don't know, maybe in years to come, but at the moment, I'm quite content with leaving those feelings where they are and trying to carry on with a profession that I still love.\"\nSister Jakes said she had completed a dissertation on the psychological impact of the pandemic on staff, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\"There was a massive jump in nurses that were affected by PTSD, nightmares and flashbacks,\" she said.\n\"A lot were then unable to cope, so they've had to leave their career within critical care to explore other avenues for their mental health and wellbeing.\"\nIn a recently published NHS staff survey, the East of England had the highest number of staff who often found work emotionally exhausting (28%) and suffered from burnout (24%).\nThe number is down from 2021 but Sister Jakes said \"quite a few\" of her colleagues still had Long Covid and those who had lost relatives and loved ones could not forget and \"they shouldn't forget\".\nDr Parvez Moondi worked as a consultant in the same department.\nHe said one of the worst things was seeing patients and families separated.\n\"We tried to do our best with iPads because people weren't allowed to visit but it was quite distressing to see patients suffer without their loved ones nearby,\" he said.\n\"I'm not surprised lots of people were traumatised.\"\nDr Moondi worked four consecutive 12-hour shifts, staying at the hospital to protect his own family.\nHis children were teenagers at the time, with one studying for GCSEs.\nSister Jakes home-schooled her child, who was then five, after deciding the risk of him bringing the illness home was too great.\n\"My school definitely required improvement!\" she said. \"It just seems like such a lifetime ago.\"\nShe said she hoped they would be able to respond to any future pandemic better - and more efficiently.\n\"Over Christmas we got a few more flu patients and that stirred up some emotions because we were pulling out the gowns and the masks and everything again,\" she said.\n\"They [some staff] were almost a bit like 'this is a bit close to home, I don't think I really want to do this again', but it never reached that peak.\"\nDr Moondi said it was not until the studies came out that they had become better at treating Covid and ensuring better outcomes.\n\"It was quite an horrendous time, you wouldn't want to go through that again,\" he added.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "text": "In October 2020 Liverpool's Covid rates were rising at a terrifying pace and the city was about to become the first area in England to enter the strictest of the government's new three-tier system of restrictions.\nThe country had already seen one lockdown beginning early that year in March, with restrictions that had been gradually eased over the summer but, in many areas, the beginning of autumn had seen a sharp jump in cases of the virus.\nBy then, local hospitals were on the verge of being overwhelmed and on the eve of the new lockdown staff from the Royal Liverpool's critical care unit appeared on BBC News urging the public not to have one final night out.\nVoices muffled behind masks and layers of PPE, they spoke of their dismay and disbelief that it was all happening again, and their fears for the weeks ahead.\n\"This is not sustainable. This just isn't sustainable,\" nurse Louise Lightfoot told the camera.\nFour and a half years on, looking back at that TV report, Louise gives a little shudder.\n\"Seeing it now brings back the memories of working in that intense environment and reminds me of how resilient we were,\" she said.\n\"It was a very scary time \u2013 unprecedented. However, we came together and we worked together the best way we know how.\"\nThe pressure on critical care units became ever more intense as patient numbers increased.\n\"I think there was a lot of adrenaline pumping. A lot of us didn't really stop to process how stressful it was at the time,\" said Louise.\nBut once that adrenaline had ebbed, many critical care staff around the country struggled to process what they had gone through and seen.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic in particular, the death rate in intensive care units had been more than twice the normal figure.\nStaff also struggled with the fact that relatives were unable to visit patients until the end - and sometimes not at all.\nLouise said some of her colleagues had ended up with post-traumatic stress disorder and others had left nursing altogether.\n\"The aftermath just impacted too much on their own lives so they just came away and did something completely different,\" she says.\n\"I just think the critical care environment is quite a stressful environment anyway day to day so I think with Covid on top of that, the immense pressure people were feeling was just too much for them to carry on day to day.\"\nLouise still works on the unit but changed her job to work as a staff trainer, a fact she partly puts down to having worked through Covid.\nShe says she uses the pandemic and examples from it during her teaching sessions but other than that: \"We don't tend to talk that much about it. I think it's because people don't want to think about it.\"\nThe Royal Liverpool moved to a new hospital building in 2022.\nThe old building, which sits opposite the new, is currently being torn down. Louise said the move had made it easier for staff to break with the past.\n\"They don't want to look back at that. I think the staff just want to look forward now rather than back.\"\nBut some changes made during the pandemic have continued.\nInfection control, always important in critical care, was tightened during Covid and remains so now.\nLouise said staff were now more vigilant in asking patients' relatives to wear masks if they had a cough or a cold.\n\"Now we are thankfully in a place where we can put it behind us but also I just want people to be aware,\" she said.\n\"Hopefully we will never see anything like this again in our lifetime but we can never say never. We don't want to see anything on that scale again.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.

The foundation said it aims to promote fitness and support mental health.\n\"The social aspect is just as important as the cricket. So many of the people I've met here have become friends,\" said Penny, who attends the Highbridge sessions.\n\"Having a women's only session is really encouraging. There are mixed groups but some people just feel a lot more comfortable playing with other women,\" added Penny.\nElaine has also been enjoying the sessions. She said: \"It's great fun and it's nice to meet other women from other groups and be part of a community.\n\"I've watched cricket for 40 years and when I heard about walking cricket I had to come and have a look.\n\"It was intimidating at first but the lads made me feel welcome and I just felt like a big kid in a playground - I've not stopped smiling in 12 months.\"\nThe foundation runs ten walking cricket hubs across Somerset in locations including Wells, Bath and Weston-super-Mare.\nMixed sessions where men and women play together are available.\n\"We want to encourage more physical activity to help with other challenges around healthy living and mental health,\" said Mustafa Shaikh, community activation officer at Somerset Cricket Foundation.\n\"Walking cricket is having a massive impact on people's lives and we just want to get the message out there that cricket can be for everyone and you can have a lot of fun.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "text": "A vulnerable woman almost missed the legal cut-off point for an abortion partly because of annual leave at a health board, a court heard.\nThe mother of the woman, who has been sectioned a number of times, told a court she was \"traumatised\" by the \"barbaric\" treatment of her daughter as she watched her continue her pregnancy into the second trimester.\nThe Court of Protection judgment found the \"unreasonable delay\" by Cardiff and Vale University Health Board had a \"serious negative impact\" on the woman, who is in her 30s.\nThe health board has accepted there had been a delay.\nWarning: This story contains details which some readers might find upsetting\nThe woman had two days before it would not have been legally possible to have a medical abortion, which can be carried out up to 24 weeks gestation.\n\"This should've happened weeks and weeks ago and never been allowed to get to the stage where she is in the second trimester,\" her mother told the Royal Courts of Justice.\nThe patient, who has a history of substance abuse and has been detained under the Mental Health Act a number of times, was about eight weeks pregnant in June 2024.\nThe court in London heard the woman \u2013 who cannot be identified for legal reasons - was confused about basic details about her pregnancy and at one point did not believe she was still pregnant, despite having accepted a positive result.\nAlthough she initially said she wanted an abortion, the patient constantly changed her mind about it.\nThe woman's mother told the court that her daughter's understanding was \"sometimes good and sometimes bad\".\nBut the patient told her mum she wanted to \"get rid of the baby and have a tablet\".\nThe mother told the official solicitor - someone that acts for people who are vulnerable because of their lack of mental capacity in some courts - that her daughter might think there was a \"magic pill\" that would \"make it all go away\".\nBecause of this, the health board asked for a \"treatment plan\" authorised by the Court of Protection, a court that makes decision on behalf people who lack the capacity to do so for themselves.\nThe health board said the treatment plan would make sure the woman remained safe throughout the termination - if she decided to proceed - and her life was not put at risk.\nThis would include a deprivation of her liberty - giving medical experts the power to restrain or sedate her if they felt it was needed.\nFrom 2 August last year, her wish to have a termination remained consistent and proceeds were issued by the health board two weeks later on 16 August.\nOn 12 September, Judge Butler-Cole KC found the woman lacked capacity to make decisions regarding termination of her pregnancy and authorised Cardiff and Vale Health Board's suggested treatment plan.\nThe patient went ahead with a medical abortion immediately after the plan was agreed. The deprivation of liberty proposed in the plan wasn't needed in the end and clinicians say the woman is doing well.\nBut the health board, which describes itself as one of the largest NHS organisations in Europe, was criticised by Judge Butler-Cole.\n\"The health board explains that there were staff absences due to annual leave over the summer break which explain the delay in issuing the application,\" Judge Butler-Cole said.\n\"In the circumstances of this case, where every day that passed meant that the options for her narrowed, and she herself had to continue with a pregnancy she had decided she did not want, four weeks was simply too long.\n\"In my judgement, an application should have been prioritised and made at the very latest by 26 July 2024.\n\"If it had been, a decision would likely have been made by the court by mid-August, rather than mid-September.\n\"While that may not have made any difference to the type of termination she had, it would have saved her a month of waiting and wondering why her expressed wishes were not being acted on as her pregnancy progressed.\n\"It would have meant that the procedure she underwent had lower risks of physical or mental harm.\"\nThe judge considered it appropriate to reflect the court's \"disapproval of the health board's conduct in the case, its impact on the woman and her family\".\nAcknowledging the psychological and physical burden on the patient and her family, the judge made an order the health board paid most of the legal fees.\nCardiff and Vale health board said it cannot comment on details of an individual patient's care.\nBut a spokesperson added: \"As a health board we endeavour to manage any case of this nature and complexity very carefully via our mental health and gynaecological teams.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",

        "text": "Some businesses were born in Covid, while the lockdowns marked the end of the road for others. The rest were forced to adapt to have any hope of surviving.\nFive years on from the pandemic, the BBC has spoken to small business owners about both the opportunities and the fallout from the pandemic.\nMyanara Wander, 24, played netball professionally before coronavirus hit, but when sporting events dried up she started a Caribbean takeaway business.\n\"We started as a little takeaway service in a small flat in Hatfield. We set up on Deliveroo and Uber Eats, and then people started asking for catering, and it grew from there.\"\nIn the past five years, MJ Eats has grown into an events and hospitality brand offering Caribbean and pan-Asian food, networking and job opportunities including model casting.\n\"We went from one employee to 50. We have models, chefs, kitchen staff, creative staff, event managers.\"\nMya's grandfather is co-founder, responsible for logistics and HR. He was also the company's first investor.\n\"He gave me the first \u00a3150, so we bought a fryer and some tongs,\" Mya says. \"He is now the person who does the heavy lifting. It's great to have that alliance with somebody I love.\"\nMya says despite the company's growth, she's faced challenges along the way.\n\"There are very few people who want to give a young black girl five, 10, 20 grand to start a business with. So MJ Eats is funded primarily by myself.\"\nThe Confederation of British Industry estimates that some 800,000 companies were registered in the first year of the pandemic, a 22% increase compared with the previous year.\nMya believes the pandemic gave her the opportunity to start something new.\n\"I think Covid was revolutionary. If it didn't happen, I wouldn't have stopped playing netball, or taken the time to invest in myself. It went from a side hustle to this. It was never supposed to happen!\"\nPenny Burdett has been a knitwear designer for 38 years. Before Covid, she had a clothes shop based in Camden Lock.\n\"I was right near where the boats came in. I had my knitting machine there and made my work on the premises. People came from all over the world.\"\nAfter multiple lockdowns were imposed, she gave up her shop because her turnover plummeted.\n\"Covid was a nightmare,\" Penny says. \"We had to ask the market to shut down because there was nobody coming at all. The place was deserted.\"\nShe went from employing three to four people, including textiles students, to working alone in her home studio.\nPenny now sells her clothes online but finds it \"much harder than selling face-to-face because you can't show people how beautiful the garments are\".\n\"Looking back at Covid, I think it was a double-edged sword,\" the designer says. \"It made me feel I should be more innovative.\"\nBut Penny says that five years on from Covid, she feels \"displaced\".\nHenal Chotai opened the Red Cup Cafe in Harrow with his wife Reena in 2015.\n\"It was a dream for me and my wife. It was our baby - we were here seven days a week.\"\nWhen Covid hit, the couple went into action to help the local community.\n\"We gave out biscuits, sweets and care packages to nurses, doctors and the ambulance service. We also fundraised.\"\nThe cafe also signed up to the Eat Out to Help Out programme, but Henal felt the scheme was \"chaotic\".\n\"Everybody was taking advantage of it and we were trying to observe all the rules.\"\nHenal and his wife decided to close the cafe in 2022, due to the financial fallout from the pandemic.\nThey took out a government loan, which they paid back, but rising bills made it financially unviable for the business to continue.\n\"We managed to get through Covid but with the increases in prices, increase in rent... it was unsustainable. We had to put our heart to one side, and put a business head on.\"\nFive years on, Henal has mixed feelings.\n\"It brings back memories of a sad time, of not knowing what was going to happen next,\" he says.\n\"I look at the joyous moments that we had, the hundreds of people per day that we helped. It was a great opportunity.\"\nHenal has changed career and is now a life coach.\n\"I realised I had a good rapport with people and I was able to help them with their lives. I still want to help out the community.\"\nHenal believes the hospitality industry needs \"drastic help\".\nBut with looming tax rises in April, businesses are facing further financial challenges.\nHenal says he wants the government \"to reverse their decision on National Insurance, reduce VAT, look at the business rates\".\nAccording to research by CGA and AlixPartners, there were almost exactly the same number of hospitality premises in 2024 as 12 months earlier.\nKarl Chessell, from CGA, says that \"after thousands of net closures during Covid and the period of high inflation that followed, 2024 brought some welcome respite\" but he warns \"there was a constant turnover of sites, with a total of 4,078 closures and 4,085 openings. In other words, an average of 11 venues a day closed their doors.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses wants the government to \"set a target of supporting and encouraging 500,000 more small businesses to exist by January 2028 across the UK\".\nIt believes this could help take the small-business community back to its \"pre-pandemic size of six million across the UK\", would reduce \"economic inactivity\" and \"cut the benefits bill\".\nA government spokesperson said it recognised the \"vital importance of small businesses to our economy\" and was \"protecting the smallest businesses from the employer National Insurance rise and late payments, and capping corporation tax\".",

        "text": "Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England have fallen for the first time in 15 years, according to the children's charity Coram.\nIt comes as the government continues to roll out its funded childcare scheme, which will provide all eligible working parents of pre-school children, not only three and four-year-olds as currently, with 30 hours of childcare per week from September.\nHowever, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".\nIn England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.\nHowever, currently parents of children under three years old can access 15 hours a week of childcare paid for by the government.\nCoram Family and Childcare's annual survey shows the impact of the changes, with eligible working parents seeing a 22% reduction in their annual cost.\nElsewhere, prices have risen for childminders, nurseries, pre-schools and after-school care.\nWales is now the most expensive place in Great Britain for a full-time nursery place for a child under two, which costs \u00a315,038.\nThe cost for three and four-year-olds has risen across England, Wales and Scotland.\nCoram Family and Childcare's head, Lydia Hodges, said that while the funded hours in England are \"a welcome step\" for making childcare affordable for working parents, the system now needs to be rebalanced.\nShe says parents ineligible for the funded childcare \"are unlikely to be able to meet the cost involved in giving their children the same amount of early education that other children get for free\".\nThe report also found that the availability of nursery and childminder places varies between council areas, with the lowest provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities and families living in rural areas.\nFor Meg Pattern, who is eight months' pregnant, the funded hours have been a massive help and brought her childcare costs down.\nHowever, securing a space for her second child has been difficult because of the increase in demand.\nShe says she has tried all of the local settings, including the nursery her three-year-old son Rupert goes to, but they are full until September 2026.\nThe nearest one with availability next April is a 40-minute drive from her house, in the opposite direction to work.\n\"I told them when I was eight weeks' pregnant, which is pretty early,\" she says.\n\"It's really stressful - when I go back to work, I'll have both kids going in opposite ways.\"\nHer son Rupert is eligible for 30 hours of government funding per week, but his nursery only has a space for two days.\nIt means Meg's parents, who also live in north Birmingham, are helping out until he starts school.\nJoeli Brearley, from the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, says the decrease in cost for under-twos is \"a milestone worth celebrating\", but that \"a looming crisis in availability threatens to leave families stranded\".\nThe Children's Garden Day Nursery in Stamford has a waiting list until September 2026.\nWorking parents who already have a space are now requesting more hours from this September, when the government will double the number of hours for which their children are eligible.\nClaire Kenyon, the owner, says she is considering capping the amount of funded hours people can use, or pulling out of the scheme altogether, because she cannot balance the books.\nThis would mean fewer government-funded nursery places available. The government estimated 70,000 additional spaces will be needed by this September because of the increase in demand.\nMs Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.\nLast month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".\nHowever, Ms Kenyon says some nurseries have been using these payments as a way to subsidise the funding for three and four-year-olds, and that more than 5,000 nurseries have now signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.\n\"The government has decided to impose stricter rules on us, and I think some nurseries are just saying, 'We can't do it - if we want to keep our businesses and our staff employed we're going to have to pull out'.\"\nChanges to National Insurance are also adding further financial pressure. Ms Kenyon says she will have to pay an additional \u00a3200,000 a year in staff costs from April.\nThe National Day Nurseries Association says nurseries would have to increase their fees by around 10% to remain sustainable.\nIn December, the government announced that early years funding would increase by \u00a32bn this year to support the expansion.\nNeil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, says their research suggests many providers are choosing to limit their funded places, or opt out of the offers entirely, \"due to unsustainable financial pressures\".\nAbout 185 nurseries out of 1,100 surveyed by the charity said they were \"likely\" to opt out of the scheme entirely within the next 12 months.\nThere are different types of support available for families across Great Britain.\nThirty hours a week of funded childcare during term time is available to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds in Scotland regardless of their parents' working status, according to the Scottish government.\nThe Welsh government says its focus is on the \"most disadvantaged communities\", and is expanding childcare support for two-year-olds across Wales.\nPhillipson says delivering a better early-years system \"is a top priority\".\nAnd there is \"much more to come from September, as government funding increases from 15 to 30 hours a week\" for working families.\nData analysis by Wesley Stephenson\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "text": "Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England have fallen for the first time in 15 years, according to the children's charity Coram.\nIt comes as the government continues to roll out its funded childcare scheme, which will provide all eligible working parents of pre-school children, not only three and four-year-olds as currently, with 30 hours of childcare per week from September.\nHowever, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".\nIn England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.\nHowever, currently parents of children under three years old can access 15 hours a week of childcare paid for by the government.\nCoram Family and Childcare's annual survey shows the impact of the changes, with eligible working parents seeing a 22% reduction in their annual cost.\nElsewhere, prices have risen for childminders, nurseries, pre-schools and after-school care.\nWales is now the most expensive place in Great Britain for a full-time nursery place for a child under two, which costs \u00a315,038.\nThe cost for three and four-year-olds has risen across England, Wales and Scotland.\nCoram Family and Childcare's head, Lydia Hodges, said that while the funded hours in England are \"a welcome step\" for making childcare affordable for working parents, the system now needs to be rebalanced.\nShe says parents ineligible for the funded childcare \"are unlikely to be able to meet the cost involved in giving their children the same amount of early education that other children get for free\".\nThe report also found that the availability of nursery and childminder places varies between council areas, with the lowest provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities and families living in rural areas.\nFor Meg Pattern, who is eight months' pregnant, the funded hours have been a massive help and brought her childcare costs down.\nHowever, securing a space for her second child has been difficult because of the increase in demand.\nShe says she has tried all of the local settings, including the nursery her three-year-old son Rupert goes to, but they are full until September 2026.\nThe nearest one with availability next April is a 40-minute drive from her house, in the opposite direction to work.\n\"I told them when I was eight weeks' pregnant, which is pretty early,\" she says.\n\"It's really stressful - when I go back to work, I'll have both kids going in opposite ways.\"\nHer son Rupert is eligible for 30 hours of government funding per week, but his nursery only has a space for two days.\nIt means Meg's parents, who also live in north Birmingham, are helping out until he starts school.\nJoeli Brearley, from the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, says the decrease in cost for under-twos is \"a milestone worth celebrating\", but that \"a looming crisis in availability threatens to leave families stranded\".\nThe Children's Garden Day Nursery in Stamford has a waiting list until September 2026.\nWorking parents who already have a space are now requesting more hours from this September, when the government will double the number of hours for which their children are eligible.\nClaire Kenyon, the owner, says she is considering capping the amount of funded hours people can use, or pulling out of the scheme altogether, because she cannot balance the books.\nThis would mean fewer government-funded nursery places available. The government estimated 70,000 additional spaces will be needed by this September because of the increase in demand.\nMs Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.\nLast month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".\nHowever, Ms Kenyon says some nurseries have been using these payments as a way to subsidise the funding for three and four-year-olds, and that more than 5,000 nurseries have now signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.\n\"The government has decided to impose stricter rules on us, and I think some nurseries are just saying, 'We can't do it - if we want to keep our businesses and our staff employed we're going to have to pull out'.\"\nChanges to National Insurance are also adding further financial pressure. Ms Kenyon says she will have to pay an additional \u00a3200,000 a year in staff costs from April.\nThe National Day Nurseries Association says nurseries would have to increase their fees by around 10% to remain sustainable.\nIn December, the government announced that early years funding would increase by \u00a32bn this year to support the expansion.\nNeil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, says their research suggests many providers are choosing to limit their funded places, or opt out of the offers entirely, \"due to unsustainable financial pressures\".\nAbout 185 nurseries out of 1,100 surveyed by the charity said they were \"likely\" to opt out of the scheme entirely within the next 12 months.\nThere are different types of support available for families across Great Britain.\nThirty hours a week of funded childcare during term time is available to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds in Scotland regardless of their parents' working status, according to the Scottish government.\nThe Welsh government says its focus is on the \"most disadvantaged communities\", and is expanding childcare support for two-year-olds across Wales.\nPhillipson says delivering a better early-years system \"is a top priority\".\nAnd there is \"much more to come from September, as government funding increases from 15 to 30 hours a week\" for working families.\nData analysis by Wesley Stephenson\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "text": "The number of overseas students at Scottish universities dropped by more than 10,000 last year, new figures show.\nThe decline comes after foreign student numbers reached an all-time high in the previous year, making their tuition fees an important source of funding for universities.\nThe latest figures from HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) show there were 73,915 students from outside the UK, down 12% from 83,975 the year before.\nThe statistics also show there were 173,795 students from Scotland at Scottish universities.\nThe number of European Union students in Scotland fell by half as Britain left the EU in 2019 and it has continued to fall in the current figures, down to just 10,430.\nMeanwhile, the share of foreign students had been rising from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four in recent years.\nThe largest number of overseas students in Scotland is from China.\nIt fell from 19,000 in 2022/23 to 17,565 last year.\nStudents from India fell from 12,235 to 9,950 and Nigerian students dropped from 9,415 to 5,985.\nThe number of students from Pakistan increased from 5,075 to 5,540\nDundee University, which recently announced a \u00a335m black hole in its finances, saw a 27% drop in international students - down from 4,570 to 3,335.\nThe University of Glasgow saw a 15% drop in overseas students, down from 15,200 to 12,935.\nThe biggest drop was Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen where the number of overseas students almost halved, down to 2,365.\nHowever, the University of Edinburgh, which has also announced financial shortfalls, managed to increase its number of overseas students last year from 16,625 to 17,020.\nScottish students get \"free tuition\" at Scottish universities which means undergraduates do not have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.\nHowever, universities have long claimed that the money it receives from the Scottish government has not kept pace with inflation and is less per student than similar institutions in England get from tuition fees.\nScottish universities, like most in the UK, have been on a recruitment drive to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.\nFor those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has risen to close to 40%.\nThis has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.\nIt has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.\nA growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.\nNigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.\nBut the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.\nOther factors, such as tighter visa restrictions and stronger competition from other countries, have led to further falls.\nEarlier this week, a senior Dundee University figure told MSPs that insolvency was a \"real possibility\" as the institution attempts to tackle a \u00a335m funding black hole.\nActing chair of court Tricia Bey said without forthcoming financial support from the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) the university will run out of money by the end of June.\nLast week, the university announced that 632 jobs would be cut, about one-fifth of the workforce.\nIt said that factors including a \"severe drop\" in international student recruitment and an increase in National Insurance contributions were to blame for the deficit.\nHowever, it added that internal factors including \"inadequate financial discipline and control\" and \"poor capital planning and investment decisions\" had also contributed to the situation.\nThe University and College Union (UCU) Scotland said staff were being made to pay the price for \"egregious management failure\".\nEdinburgh University also plans \u00a3140m of cuts to tackle severe financial difficulties.\nThe university's principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Peter Mathieson, said in a message to staff that \"radical action\" would be needed to ensure a \"sustainable reduction\" in costs to help the institution cope with falling income and higher bills.\nThe drop in income was partly blamed on a lower number of international students coming to the UK.\nThe Scottish government said international student numbers had seen a decline following changes by the UK government to the immigration system, such as ending the inclusion of family members on student visas.",

        "text": "The former head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, has criticised the education secretary and accused her of giving \"a great deal of time and attention\" to the teaching unions.\nSpeaking to the Daily Telegraph, Ms Spielman claims \"effective reforms are being reversed\" - referring to potential changes to academy schools' powers.\nThe Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is set to change the rules around how academies pay their staff and the material they can teach, which critics say threatens their autonomy.\nBut the Department for Education (DfE) says its \"landmark\" reforms deliver on its mission to ensure all schools can attract and retain the best teachers.\nIn a piece covering academies, qualifications, the curriculum and Ofsted itself, the ex-chief of the organisation says the education secretary should reconsider the reforms in the bill \"before the damage is done\".\nMs Spielman stepped down as head of Ofsted at the end of 2023.\nAn inquiry into Ofsted was launched that year, after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who died by suicide following an Ofsted inspection.\nMs Spielman accuses the education secretary of using \"polished verbiage and jazz hands\" when announcing policies, and claimed some policies had been \"influenced by education union leaders and activists\".\nWhile education unions have supported the government in some areas, they have also been critical in others, including on the proposals for new Ofsted report cards.\nBut Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"\nSpeaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.\nA government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.\nShe responded by saying it was \"fascinating because that's a union line\", reiterating her criticism of the organisations which she says have been \"attacking accountability and attacking inspection from long before I became chief inspector\".\nIn The Telegraph piece, the ex-Ofsted head also says the government's proposals for academies will \"cut the autonomy of schools and school groups right back\".\nShe says she is \"astonished by the speed and thoroughness with which Bridget Phillipson has moved to dismantle every main pillar of the system\".\nThe schools bill, due to go before MPs again on Monday, includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.\nSeveral issues covered by the bill, including safeguarding, have been met positively by school leaders.\nMore controversial and debated elements have been around academy reforms, which may limit academies' powers to manage their pay and working practices differently to schools run by local authorities.\nAfter facing opposition from academy leaders, the government has since clarified that it intends the pay framework to be a \"floor not a ceiling\", meaning academy bosses will still be able to pay teachers more if they choose to.\nPhillipson previously called political attempts to halt the bill \"utterly sickening\", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme the children's bill was \"the single biggest piece of children safeguarding legislation in a generation\".\nResponding to Ms Spielman's claims, a DfE spokesperson said the bill, alongside other reforms, \"delivers on our mission for every child to have a good, local school, will get high-quality teachers into every classroom, and ensure that all schools can innovate to attract and retain the best talent\".",

        "text": "The poorest children are missing more school and falling further behind classmates, research shared with the BBC suggests.\nAccording to new analysis by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) - which looked at pupil performance after the Covid-19 pandemic - children from the lowest income families are now up to 19 months behind peers by the time they are 16 years old.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.\nThe latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.\nIt comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.\nHowever, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.\nNatalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.\nHer team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.\nMs Perera said more research was needed to understand why these children struggled to be in school, with possible factors including poor housing and mental health.\nIt is five years since the UK went into lockdown, when schools closed to most children.\nPlaygroups and nurseries also shut, with parents of babies and toddlers isolated from their extended family. There were other changes too, as health visitors were re-deployed or in contact with parents only online.\nPanorama has heard from families and teachers about the impact on these children, who are just starting or are still in primary school.\nSchools say some have delayed speech and understanding of words, or have slower social or emotional development, or they lack basic skills normally picked up through play.\nProfessor Catherine Davies, from the University of Leeds, says some children missed out on \"fundamental skills\" they need to make sense of school and get on with wider groups.\nAt Queen's Drive Primary School, in Preston, teaching assistant Sarah Barraclough has been trained in a national programme to help four and five-year-olds in England with speech and language.\nShe says the impact of Covid has been \"huge\" and if they don't learn to say and understand more words, children then become isolated. \"You're lonely and not getting involved in the games in the playground,\" she says.\nEmaan, now aged four, was born during the first UK lockdown and is one of the children receiving help through Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI).\nHis parents, Ruby and Charles, really notice the difference between Emaan and his older brother. During the pandemic, Emaan barely went out and met other people.\nCharles says there is a \"stark difference\" between their sons and that Emaan is a lot more clingy.\nThe NELI programme to train teaching assistants is funded until the end of this school year in England. But beyond then, funding has not yet been confirmed.\nThe government has set a 2028 target for 75% of children - up from 68% - to reach a good level of development by the time they leave reception.\nSome of the cultural shifts caused by the lockdowns and partial school closures could prove to be the hardest to resolve.\nThe education secretary told the BBC the pandemic had profoundly changed attitudes towards attendance. She said it was important the youngest pupils got the \"support they need to thrive\".",

        "text": "Scotland's universities are hitting a crunch point with their finances, forcing job losses on a scale we used to see from major factory closures and raising questions about whether they can all survive.\nDundee University is cutting 632 full-time jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce - as it tries to tackle a \u00a335m deficit, and its underlying financial position looks even worse.\nThe University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months. That figure is equivalent to about a tenth of the annual spending at the institution, which now has about 15,000 staff on its payroll.\nAberdeen University has also cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes, while the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\" - which usually means they are bound to go.\nIt has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.\nWhen the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.\nThey all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.\nSo what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?\nScottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.\nThe Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).\nUniversities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.\nIt says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.\nThe figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.\nIt says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.\nWhile the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.\nBut that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.\nUsing a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.\nThe IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.\nUndergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.\nThese are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.\nStudents from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.\nWhile the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.\nHowever, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.\nThe maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.\nBecause England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.\nThe more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.\nThe vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.\nWith these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.\nUK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.\nThe number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.\nFor those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.\nThe most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.\nThis has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.\nIt has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.\nGrowth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.\nIt fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.\nThe volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.\nA growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.\nChinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.\nNigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.\nBut the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.\nDundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.\nNumbers were also affected by visa restrictions.\nIn order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.\nIt also restricted visas for students' family dependents.\nThe biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.\nThese tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.\nSome international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.\nA further factor is that competition has been growing.\nThe UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.\nThat now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.\nTo increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.\nAnd with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.\nTen years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.\nIn 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.\nThat level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.\nIt becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.\nAn external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.\nIts interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".\nDundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.\nSubjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.\nLanguage departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.\nThe Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.\nBut money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.\nSome see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.\nOthers see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.\nAnd there may be value in a crisis such as this.\nWith a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.\nOn funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.\nWhat comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.\nIn the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.\nScotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change.",

        "text": "The UK has been one of the most popular destinations for international students in recent years - but is its appeal starting to fade?\nHome Office figures show UK sponsored study visas dropped by 31% \u2013 from 600,024 in 2023 to 415,103 in 2024 - and with this, money many university cities rely on.\nUniversities UK, which represents 141 institutions, says measures to reduce net migration have \"created significant uncertainty around the UK's post-study work offer\".\nThe government says international students \"will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially\".\nCoventry in the West Midlands is particularly dependent on the international student economy.\nIn 2022-23, of universities with at least 10,000 students, Coventry University had the second highest percentage of international students in England outside London.\nThere were 16,285 non-UK students out of a total of 35,405, according to the most recent figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).\nJingwen Yuan, 30, spent seven years as a construction project manager in her native China, where she oversaw building projects that housed more people than are found in some UK cities.\nThe Coventry University alumnus has a masters degree in advanced engineering management and paid \u00a33,000 to stay in the UK on a graduate visa while looking for work - but has been unable to find a job.\n\"All of my bachelor degrees classmates from home have gone back to China,\" she says.\n\"My friend got \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 from our government if she came back. And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay \u00a33,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?\"\n\"The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,\" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India.\nStudent visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses.\nThere was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024.\nMohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones.\nCoventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately \u00a316,800 \u2013 \u00a320,050 per year for international students.\nThat's compared to \u00a39,250 for domestic students, which will rise to \u00a39,535 in September.\nCoventry University says Brexit has had \"a profound impact\" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students.\nThe House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22.\nSince August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.\nLaura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University.\nThe 21-year-old from Spain says: \"There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome\".\nBut she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there.\nThe Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK.\nWhilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased.\nUCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025\nHowever this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses.\nThe overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy.\nSo it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy.\nCoventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about \u00a3651m a year for the city's economy.\nOne sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use.\nThe volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications.\nEstate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.\nCoventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: \"It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders.\n\"Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do.\n\"The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control.\"\nThe government says its Immigration White Paper will set out \"a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth.\"\nVivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities.\n\"There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis.\n\"It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry.",

        "text": "A US court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week.\nBadar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral fellow studying and teaching at the prestigious Washington DC institution on a student visa.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of \"spreading Hamas propaganda\" and having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist\".\nMr Suri's lawyer and employer have denied the allegation. His lawyer said in a court filing that his client was targeted because of his wife's \"identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech\".\nIn an order on Thursday, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Mr Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order\".\nIn a sworn statement, his wife Mapheze Saleh said the detention \"has completely upended our lives\" and appealed to the court to allow Mr Suri to return home to his family.\n\"Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly,\" she said. \"As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.\"\nHis arrest follows the detention or deportation of other foreign students and academics, including Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist.\nMr Suri was arrested outside his home in northern Virginia on Monday night by masked immigration agents, according to legal filings seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nHe was told the agents were with DHS, the filings say, and they informed him the government had revoked his visa and he was now facing expulsion from the country.\nMr Suri was taken to Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana where he is being held, according to US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, said on X that Mr Suri was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\".\nShe accused him of having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas\" without providing any further detail.\nMr Suri's father-in-law is a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the Washington Post and New York Times reported.\nIn her court statement, Ms Saleh said her father lived in the US for nearly 20 years while pursuing a master's and PhD. \"Afterward, he served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as the deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza,\" she said.\nMs Saleh said he left the Gaza government in 2010 and \"started the House of Wisdom in 2011 to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza\".\nMr Suri's court filings allege that he and his wife Mapheze Saleh - a US citizen of Palestinian descent - had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\".\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Suri's lawyer for more details.\nA spokesman for Georgetown University told the BBC that Mr Suri had been \"granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan\".\nThe institution was \"not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention\".\n\"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,\" the spokesman said. \"We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"\nIn her post on X, Ms McLaughlin said Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\".\nThe BBC has contacted DHS to request more detail on the allegations against Mr Suri, and also asked the Indian embassy in Washington DC for comment.\nSeveral students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for \"violence and terrorism\".\nKhalil, a Columbia graduate and permanent US resident, was arrested on 8 March after being involved in pro-Palestinian protests on campus. He was accused of having ties to Hamas, which he denies.\nColumbia student Leqaa Kordia, who is a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested for \"overstaying her student visa\". She had previously been arrested in April 2024 for taking part in protests at Columbia University, according to DHS.\nRanjani Srinivasan, another Columbia University student, chose to \"self-deport\". Officials said her student visa was revoked on 5 March. Her lawyers say she attended a handful of protests and had shared or liked social media posts related to Palestinians in Gaza.\nBrown University professor and kidney transplant specialist Rasha Alawieh, who is Lebanese, was deported after arriving at Boston airport. US officials said they found \"photos and videos\" on her cell phone that were \"sympathetic\" to the former longtime leader of Hezbollah and militants.\nAccording to a transcript of her interview reviewed by Reuters, she told customs officials she did not support Hezbollah but had high regard for its leader because of her religion.\n\"I'm not a political person,\" she said. \"I'm a physician.

        "text": "US President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order demanding the shutdown of the Department of Education - a long-held goal of conservatives.\nSince the Republican returned to the White House, the department has already announced plans to slash about half of its workforce.\nBut totally shutting down the agency would be difficult without an act of Congress.\nEstablished in 1979, the department oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.\nTrump and his allies have accused the agency of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual and political material.\nA common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.\nThe agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.\nIt also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty.\nAnd the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools.\nThe department's allocation was $238bn (\u00a3188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget.\nThe agency has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department.\nMost public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments.\nIn 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil.\nOn his own, no.\nNot only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators.\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot.\nEven in the House of Representatives, Trump might struggle to gain necessary support.\nA vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no.\nTrump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves.\nA draft of Trump's order to dismantle the education department, obtained last month by the Washington Post, acknowledged that only Congress could get rid of the agency outright, but executive action could direct the agency to begin to wind itself down.\nEducation department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce.\nThe education department oversees a huge portfolio of loans to university students, which Trump has indicated will be shifted to a different government agency.\n\"I don't think the Education [Department] should be handling the loans,\" Trump has said. \"That's not their business.\"\nExperts say it's most likely that the portfolio, which includes more than $1.5tn (\u00a31.16tn) in loans taken out by more than 40 million Americans, could be shifted to the US Department of the Treasury.\nA White House fact sheet said the order would direct the education secretary to ensure the \"uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".\nNo matter what eventually happens, borrowers will still have to pay the loans back.\nCourt rulings and Trump's policies have reversed some changes that former President Joe Biden attempted to make to lower borrowing costs and forgive some debts.\nThe idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed.\nDuring Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled.\nRepublicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities.\nMore recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as \"woke\" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race.\nTrump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools.\nConservatives argue that education department functions should be handled by other agencies, for instance that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.",

        "text": "A Welsh island is hoping working from home and its miles of beach will stop its \"unsustainable\" exodus of young people.\nA high-powered remote meeting in the morning and a quick paddleboard at lunch is the work-life balance dream Anglesey is advocating as it tries to lure back a generation that moved away for work.\nThe county off the coast of north-west Wales has seen one of the UK's sharpest birth-rate drops and \"concerned\" islanders are figuring out how to stop their \"brain drain\".\nBut local MP Llinos Medi said: \"People can come back to Ynys M\u00f4n (Welsh for Anglesey), working for a company based in London or Cardiff.\"\nThe tranquility of Anglesey makes it attractive for those that have retired but the exodus of young people in the opposite direction is \"worrying\".\nCensus data already showed the population, which is about 70,000 people, was declining and now only four other areas in England and Wales have seen a bigger drop in birth-rates than Anglesey.\nSo their fight back has begun in the hope the same natural beauty that attracts more than a million tourists a year might bring more islanders who can work remotely, like Will Matthews, back home.\nThe 35-year-old moved back from London to run holiday cottages on the island's west coast at Rhosneigr - 20 minutes from where he grew up in Llanddaniel Fab - with his brother Jack.\n\"We could run our business from anywhere but we choose to run it from here,\" said Mr Matthews, who thinks Anglesey is a nicer place to bring up his child Cosmo with wife Emily.\n\"Since Covid, companies are happier hiring people without being dependant on location and that's the big shift in my eyes.\n\"To gain those skills, unfortunately you do have to leave, but a lot of people can then come back and stay in their preferred location.\n\"I can finish work and can be out on the water in five minutes, or up on the mountains.\"\nHowever, for those unable to work from home, big and well-paid employers, like the Wylfa nuclear power plant, have closed so some have left in search of employment.\n\"The clearest way to try and buck the trend is to secure investment and see more high quality job opportunities being paid on the island,\" said Anglesey council's chief executive Dylan Williams.\n\"In professional areas we don't have enough high-quality jobs with high salaries and career progression opportunities.\"\nThe average home on the island costs \u00a3243,158 compared with the UK average of \u00a3268,087 and there are long but direct trains to London, Cardiff and Birmingham, as well as the port of Holyhead.\n\"We're a connected island and have digital connectivity,\" said Medi.\n\"We live in such a nice area. That work-life balance is something employers need to think about.\"\nBirth rates on Anglesey have dropped more than a third from 763 babies in 2013 to 486 in 2023 and the median age has risen to 48 - above the Welsh average of 42.\n\"Its quite a worrying trajectory we're on,\" Medi said.\nThe island hoped more than 1,000 well-paid jobs would be created at a new nuclear power station next to the now decommissioned old one, but 16 years since it was first proposed, Wylfa Newydd is still on the drawing board.\nThat affected some of the island's youngsters like Sion Emlyn Lloyd who planned for a career 30 miniutes from home but has now moved 300 miles away for work.\nThe 25-year-old was a Wylfa Newydd apprentice before the plan was initially shelved but landed another chance at the Hinckley Point nuclear site in Somerset.\n\"It was difficult moving to somewhere you don't know and leaving your family and friends\" said Sion.\n\"Around half of my friends from school have left the island, everyone's going across the border to England.\n\"I don't think there are enough opportunities, we need more high skilled jobs in the area. There's a risk of a brain drain and it almost becoming a retirement island.\"\nJacob, Freddy and Oli, all live in the port town of Holyhead, but all plan to move away because of the lack of opportunities and don't know if they will return.\n\"There's not a lot of opportunities for young people,\" said Jacob, who wants to work in engineering.\n\"For a more ambitious job you have to move away, there's not a lot of big jobs on the island with Wylfa shutting down.\"\nLike Jacob, Oli is also at Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern and wants to do a culinary course at university and doesn't know if he will return.\n\"It's quite boring...there's nothing to do,\" he said. \"Most places here are nice but just out of the way.\"\nDaisy, however, plans to go away to study an apprenticeship but wants to return to the island's RAF's base at Valley, where Prince William was stationed.\n\"People say there's nothing to do here,\" said the 17-year-old. \"But there's nothing to do if you don't go out and look for it.\n\"My mum works for a massive company in Cardiff but does it here because its the place she loves and where she's lived her whole life.\"\nOne primary school shut last year after only nine pupils were left on the register and some school registers have fallen \"dramatically\", so much so the council has held a public consultation over the future of its sixth form provision.\nWhile Medi said the trend is \"worrying\", she feels \"there are opportunities\".\nThe island was given freeport status in 2023 and there are tidal schemes in the pipeline off the Holyhead coast.\n\"We need to make sure we don't feed the wrong message to our young people,\" said Medi\n\"A lot of young people have been told from a very young age that there are no opportunities here but when I meet businesses, they tell me they can't fill the jobs. We maybe need to change that mindset.\"",

        "text": "When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.\nRebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.\nRebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.\nIn October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". She alleged the school only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and in a 1:1 segregated setting\". Hours were gradually added back, Rebecca said, but he remained isolated. The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThough Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.\nBut before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo.\n\"I don't have any other option for this kid,\" said Rebecca, who asked the BBC to withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy. \"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's fair.\"\nThe sudden firings, and ensuing confusion, were precursors of President Donald Trump's next big move: to try and dismantle the Department of Education entirely.\nOn Thursday, he signed an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin to \"facilitate the closure\" of the department. Congress, not the president, actually holds the power to dismantle a federal agency, and the order will likely spark legal challenges.\nBut the move has left many Americans like Rebecca uncertain about their children's future.\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt told media on Thursday that while the department will not be shut down completely, what will remain will be much smaller, and will focus on \"critical functions,\" such as federal student loans.\nOCR, she said, will be greatly reduced in \"scale and the size\".\nCuts have already begun: On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff.\nMcMahon said the downsizing showed a \"commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\"\nAlthough the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.\nThe Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings. The administration shuttered 7 of the 12 regional offices, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco.\nThis month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.\nThe news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\"\nThe attorney worried not only about the individual cases still underway, they told the BBC.\n\"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much bigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the district,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the administration.\nParents and OCR attorneys had long been frustrated with the agency's growing backlog and diminishing staff. They fear new cuts will make it impossible for the already overwhelmed division to handle the tens of thousands of complaints it receives each year.\nTasked with making sure schools are following America's civil rights laws, the OCR's job is to help ensure that students are not discriminated against because of their disability, sex, race or religion. Remedies the office helps institute could be as straightforward as adding accessibility features to school buildings or seating a near-sighted child at the front of the class. But the office also tackles complex cases involving discrimination or bullying, as well as sexual harassment and assault.\nBefore his executive order, there were already signs that the office's mission was changing.\nOCR staff had received guidance for the office to prioritise cases involving antisemitisim, the AP reported. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, has said they will take on cases involving transgender athletes at universities in order to combat \"radical transgender ideology\".\nOn 14 March, the Department of Education said it had launched investigations into more than 50 universities as part of the administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it views as exclusionary.\nStaffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. They also worried that cases involving racial minorities, or people with disabilities, will not receive the appropriate attention.\nThe office received a record 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, according to OCR's annual report. Headcount had declined even as cases increased over the years. In 1981, OCR had 1,100 full time employees. By 2024, it was down to 588.\n\"We were already so incredibly flooded with cases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our processing time.\"\nWith the new cuts, they said, \"this work will not be able to be done\".\nBut parents and educators say they will not let the Department of Education be shut down without a fight. Nikki Carter, a mother and disability advocate in Alabama, is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which is suing the Department of Education, McMahon, and Trainor over the mass job cuts.\nThe lawsuit alleges that McMahon's actions have stalled Ms Carter's racial discrimination case that was being handled by the OCR and she \"has received no indication that the investigation has resumed\".\n\"There was a lack of communication throughout the entirety of the process,\" Ms Carter told the BBC. \"When the Trump administration came in, it made that situation even worse and even more difficult.\"\nDespite her frustrations with OCR, she believed the office was still necessary to help victims of racial discrimination. She hoped the lawsuit would not only restore the office, but improve it.\n\"Children, family, as well as advocates, they don't get due process,\" Ms Carter said. \"They are being denied just basic federal educational rights. And so when you can't get that on the local and state level, the only hope that we have is to turn to the federal government.\n\"We do need OCR to go back to work,\" she said. \"And we also need OCR to be accountable for their actions \u2013 or lack thereof.\"\nMeanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him. She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates.\n\"He was treated so poorly and differently because of the way his brain was structured,\" she said. \"I want to see somebody held accountable for the way he was treated.\"",

        "text": "A Christian teacher who told pupils at a south-east London school that being LGBT+ was a \"sin\" and that transgender people were \"just confused\" has lost a High Court challenge over a finding of unprofessional conduct.\nGlawdys Leger made the comments to her year seven pupils during a presentation in a religious studies lesson at Bishop Justus Church of England School in Bromley, in February 2022.\nMs Leger, 44, argued that a professional conduct panel (PCP) had failed to put her comments in context.\nBut a judge has dismissed her case, saying that it was a \"justifiable and proportionate sanction for her unacceptable professional conduct\".\nMs Leger was suspended in March 2022 before being dismissed two months later.\nDuring a class discussion on \"allyship\", Ms Leger said that being LGBT+ was \"not fine\" and that pupils should put God before LGBTQ ideology, the PCP previously found.\nThe PCP hearing was told that Ms Leger's comments were recorded by an 11-year-old pupil, who had been advised by her mother to note down any \"transphobic\" remarks.\nThe mother then complained to the school, saying Ms Leger's comments were \"very distressing\" for her child.\nIn December 2023, the PCP found the teacher's actions amounted to unprofessional conduct, with the result of the case being published on the Teaching Regulation Agency's website, although she was not banned from teaching.\nIn her legal challenge at the High Court against the Department for Education (DfE), Ms Leger argued that the school's duty to provide a broad and balanced curriculum did not apply to her as an individual teacher.\nIn a written judgment, Mrs Justice Lang said: \"The PCP and the secretary of state made a lawful decision that publication of the findings was a justifiable and proportionate sanction for her unacceptable professional conduct.\"\nMs Leger had also argued that the decision by the PCP to publish the finding was unlawful as it infringed on her privacy and would make it \"difficult, if not impossible, to obtain new employment\".\nBut Mrs Justice Lang said the PCP had been compelled to publish its finding and \"went no further than it considered justified\".\nShe added: \"The result was the nuanced finding that while 'Ms Leger's comments lacked respect for the right of others' this did not derive 'from a lack of a tolerance' nor had she any 'intention of causing distress to pupils'.\n\"That said, her 'actions were at risk of upsetting pupils in the lesson' and her 'choice not to present a balanced view undermined the school community's aspiration to provide a supportive environment for children who may be exploring sexual identity'.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "text": "Teachers at a special school have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to help their pupils find a voice.\nFourteen-year-old Keelan from Tor Bank School in County Down, for instance, uses AI to write his own songs.\nTor Bank's ICT teacher Danielle Perry told BBC News NI that \"our children learn in a very, very different way\".\n\"Although our kids don't have voices sometimes, it's making their creations come alive,\" she said.\n\"When it comes to AI we have to be creative in how we use it.\"\nAI allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human, though computers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, there have though, been concerns from musicians about the impact of AI on their work.\nGenerative AI programs mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.\nSome universities have also found a rise in students using AI tools, such as Chat GPT, to cheat in exams and assessments.\nBut at Tor Bank, Keelan uses AI to create his own music. He is a keen drummer and likes to write songs.\n\"I like playing the drums because it helps my mind,\" he said.\nHe added that working with AI had helped him to be creative.\n\"It just makes all my favourite things into a song, I do like typing and then I like playing on the drums, drums are really good,\" he said.\nKeelan's teacher Sin\u00e9ad Oakes said AI had prompted his creativity, not replaced it.\n\"We've used AI in a way that he is able to write his own music,\" she said.\n\"And then he plays the drums and sings along to that.\n\"It's so creative and then in terms of how it has helped his emotional regulation throughout his school day, it has been phenomenal.\"\nMs Oakes also said that using technology and AI was \"a fab tool to use across the board with all of our young people\".\nBut, she said she had to \"retrain\" her mind to ensure AI was used for the benefit of her pupils.\n\"I had to kind of learn how to use it myself before I teach our young people how to use it as well,\" she continued.\nShe said that having a plan and a rationale, and a clear idea of how AI could help pupils was key.\nDanielle Perry said that while Keelan is using AI to create music, other pupils were using it to research and create presentations.\nThe pupils use an AI application called Microsoft Copilot in class.\n\"They're using it for topic research, they're using it to create colouring in pictures of designs that they have used,\" Ms Perry said.\nBut she said that \"really planning what we're doing, giving the children specific goals\" was vital.\n\"The children, all are the architects of their own learning - they're doing the learning first and then we're supporting them,\" Ms Perry said.\n\"Each of our children learn so differently and they're all individuals.\n\"I think, like anything, when new ideas come out we always have to look at 'is this suitable for the children that we teach?'\n\"And sometimes it's not.\n\"We have to think 'how can this best suit the children that we work with?'\"\nMs Perry said that for the children \"it's not about computers taking over, it's very much about giving the children their creative role in that\".\n\"For us in a special school, it's still very human-led.\"\nFor Sin\u00e9ad Oakes, it is still \"early days\" for AI in the school.\n\"It's something that we'll try and progress with as the years go on for sure,\" she said.",

        "text": "An initiative to support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) within mainstream schools could help to solve a crisis in Oxfordshire, it has been suggested.\nEnhanced pathways provide funding for teachers who can deliver small group support for children with SEND, offering bespoke and specialised curriculums.\nJo Reid, the headteacher at Botley School near Oxford, which is using a pathway, said they also made sense from a practical viewpoint.\n\"They use the spaces that we've got because of falling birth rates,\" she said.\n\"The children on our pathways are making incredible progress, they're thriving.\n\"Many also integrate well into classes with their peers too at times, so it's very inclusive. I really do believe this is the way forward.\"\nOxfordshire County Council is currently implementing a priority action plan, which includes enhanced pathways.\nIt follows a highly critical 2023 Ofsted report that found the needs of children with SEND were not being met.\nIn February the council's cabinet approved funding to double the number of pathways from 20 to 40.\nIt said it wanted to spread support as widely as possible across the county.\nMatthew has autism, ADHD and learning delays, but his mum said the enhanced pathways meant he had been able to stay with his friends and was thriving.\nMum Ruth said: \"We did think at one point he'd have to travel in a taxi for half an hour to attend a specialist school.\n\"We feel really fortunate he's able to stay at his local school, where he's been since nursery, so he still sees all his friends and in the playground. He's really happy.\"\nOxfordshire County Council's high-needs block is running a substantial financial deficit and the pathways are a spend-to-save initiative.\nThey cost about \u00a35,000 per pupil, while specialist schools can cost up to \u00a370,000 per year, per child.\nCouncil cabinet member for SEND improvement Kate Gregory said the money saved was \"important but it's secondary really\".\n\"The most important thing is that children and young people are getting the support that they desperately need and deserve,\" she said.\n\"Enhanced Pathways are a key strand when it comes to our SEND improvement plan.\"\nHowever, campaigners have said while enhanced pathways are a positive development, they only facilitate a very small number of children compared to the number in need.\nDr Claire Brenner, spokesperson for Oxfordshire SEND Parent Action Group, said: \"Obviously it is lovely to have a good news story but only a few hundred children will benefit from this.\n\"But there are thousands of children in hundreds of schools across the county that desperately need help.\"\nA council spokesperson said: \"While acknowledging that enhanced pathways do not reach all children and young people who may need it Oxfordshire County Council is doubling the current programme and will continue to review levels of provision in the future\".\n\"Schools without enhanced pathways have access to support for pupils with SEND from other council initiatives.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X, or Instagram.",

        "text": "Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England have fallen for the first time in 15 years, according to the children's charity Coram.\nIt comes as the government continues to roll out its funded childcare scheme, which will provide all eligible working parents of pre-school children, not only three and four-year-olds as currently, with 30 hours of childcare per week from September.\nHowever, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".\nIn England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.\nHowever, currently parents of children under three years old can access 15 hours a week of childcare paid for by the government.\nCoram Family and Childcare's annual survey shows the impact of the changes, with eligible working parents seeing a 22% reduction in their annual cost.\nElsewhere, prices have risen for childminders, nurseries, pre-schools and after-school care.\nWales is now the most expensive place in Great Britain for a full-time nursery place for a child under two, which costs \u00a315,038.\nThe cost for three and four-year-olds has risen across England, Wales and Scotland.\nCoram Family and Childcare's head, Lydia Hodges, said that while the funded hours in England are \"a welcome step\" for making childcare affordable for working parents, the system now needs to be rebalanced.\nShe says parents ineligible for the funded childcare \"are unlikely to be able to meet the cost involved in giving their children the same amount of early education that other children get for free\".\nThe report also found that the availability of nursery and childminder places varies between council areas, with the lowest provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities and families living in rural areas.\nFor Meg Pattern, who is eight months' pregnant, the funded hours have been a massive help and brought her childcare costs down.\nHowever, securing a space for her second child has been difficult because of the increase in demand.\nShe says she has tried all of the local settings, including the nursery her three-year-old son Rupert goes to, but they are full until September 2026.\nThe nearest one with availability next April is a 40-minute drive from her house, in the opposite direction to work.\n\"I told them when I was eight weeks' pregnant, which is pretty early,\" she says.\n\"It's really stressful - when I go back to work, I'll have both kids going in opposite ways.\"\nHer son Rupert is eligible for 30 hours of government funding per week, but his nursery only has a space for two days.\nIt means Meg's parents, who also live in north Birmingham, are helping out until he starts school.\nJoeli Brearley, from the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, says the decrease in cost for under-twos is \"a milestone worth celebrating\", but that \"a looming crisis in availability threatens to leave families stranded\".\nThe Children's Garden Day Nursery in Stamford has a waiting list until September 2026.\nWorking parents who already have a space are now requesting more hours from this September, when the government will double the number of hours for which their children are eligible.\nClaire Kenyon, the owner, says she is considering capping the amount of funded hours people can use, or pulling out of the scheme altogether, because she cannot balance the books.\nThis would mean fewer government-funded nursery places available. The government estimated 70,000 additional spaces will be needed by this September because of the increase in demand.\nMs Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.\nLast month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".\nHowever, Ms Kenyon says some nurseries have been using these payments as a way to subsidise the funding for three and four-year-olds, and that more than 5,000 nurseries have now signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.\n\"The government has decided to impose stricter rules on us, and I think some nurseries are just saying, 'We can't do it - if we want to keep our businesses and our staff employed we're going to have to pull out'.\"\nChanges to National Insurance are also adding further financial pressure. Ms Kenyon says she will have to pay an additional \u00a3200,000 a year in staff costs from April.\nThe National Day Nurseries Association says nurseries would have to increase their fees by around 10% to remain sustainable.\nIn December, the government announced that early years funding would increase by \u00a32bn this year to support the expansion.\nNeil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, says their research suggests many providers are choosing to limit their funded places, or opt out of the offers entirely, \"due to unsustainable financial pressures\".\nAbout 185 nurseries out of 1,100 surveyed by the charity said they were \"likely\" to opt out of the scheme entirely within the next 12 months.\nThere are different types of support available for families across Great Britain.\nThirty hours a week of funded childcare during term time is available to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds in Scotland regardless of their parents' working status, according to the Scottish government.\nThe Welsh government says its focus is on the \"most disadvantaged communities\", and is expanding childcare support for two-year-olds across Wales.\nPhillipson says delivering a better early-years system \"is a top priority\".\nAnd there is \"much more to come from September, as government funding increases from 15 to 30 hours a week\" for working families.\nData analysis by Wesley Stephenson\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "text": "A council's children's services department has been praised by Ofsted in its first inspection since returning in-house.\nAn independent trust ran Doncaster Council's children's services from 2014 until 2022 after the government ordered a takeover following a series of child protection failures.\nOfsted inspectors visited in January and found the now council-run service had significantly improved since 2022. It was rated as \"Good\".\nThe councillor responsible for young people and children's social care, Lani-Mae Ball, said it was \"a testament to the dedication, passion and hard work of our teams and the relentless focus of our strong leadership\".\nIn 2014 Doncaster Children's Services Trust was given a 10-year contract to run youth care in the city after a series of serious incidents.\nIn March 2009, the government ordered a takeover of Doncaster's children's services following the deaths of seven children from abuse or neglect over five years.\nLess than a year later a serious case review found an attack in the nearby village of Edlington in which two young boys were tortured by two brothers, aged 11 and 12, had been \"preventable\".\nIn July 2013 the education secretary, Michael Gove, ruled that an independent trust would run the service.\nThe trust was was due to run services until 2024, but in 2022 the council took back control after an inspection found there had been a 'significant deterioration' of social care since its last Ofsted.\nAfter the latest review inspectors described the scale of improvements as \"impressive\".\nThey found there was strong and well-established community-based services to support children at the earliest opportunity.\nInspectors concluded that children had good experiences of being in care, and said social workers made every effort to help wider family members and friends become carers so children could stay within their network when it was safe to do so.\nHowever inspectors highlighted improvements were needed in the support given to young people when leaving the care system. They found while most got the support that they needed, it was not always recognised when some needed higher levels of support.\nMayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, said the \"Good\" rating was a significant achievement which proved that the decision to bring children's services back under council control was the right one.\nShe said: \"This is just the beginning, we will continue to strive for excellence, ensuring our vulnerable children receive the support and care they deserve.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

        "text": "Teachers in Northern Ireland are again to be offered a pay rise of 5.5% as part of efforts to secure a 2024/25 pay agreement.\nThe revised agreement also contains commitments to address concerns about teacher workloads.\nIn February, the majority of teachers rejected an offer of 5.5% and started action short of strike in schools.\nA failure to deal with demands on teacher's workloads was cited by many as a reason for rejecting that previous offer.\nSome teachers also objected to a proposal that all industrial action be paused while pay negotiations took place.\nNow the teaching employers - who include the Department of Education (DE), the Education Authority (EA) and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) - are trying again.\nThe pay rise is expected to cost Stormont around \u00a348m in 2024/25 and \u00a383m as a recurring cost in future years.\nThe 5.5% pay rise will be backdated to 1 September 2024, but with the 2024/25 financial year almost at an end, time for agreement is short.\nThe Chief Executive of CCMS, Eve Bremner, said the teaching employers had made a \"significant offer\".\n\"Management Side wants to resolve this dispute and bring an end to the current industrial action, so we have worked extremely hard to secure the funding for this offer and the resources to deliver the workload measures,\" she said.\n\"While we acknowledge that not every workload concern can be resolved in one year, this would serve as a positive start.\n\"We would encourage teachers to consider the revised offer and supporting information.\"\nThe details of the pay offer are on the Department of Education's website.\nMeanwhile, the Education Minister Paul Givan has said that some pupils in Northern Ireland will sit new tests in Maths and English at primary and post-primary school.\nPupils will sit tests to assess their literacy and numeracy at the end of P4, P7 and Third form.\nBut they will only be taken by pupils in a sample of schools, rather than all schools, and will be used to assess Northern Ireland-wide performance in literacy and numeracy.\nThe tests are similar to Sats (standardised assessment tests) which are taken by primary school pupils in England to measure their performance, but individual pupils results will not be published in Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement, Givan said that the tests would be introduced in the 2025/26 school year for a three-year period and would stop Northern Ireland being an \"outlier.\"\n\"Literacy and numeracy are the essential foundation of all education,\" he said.\n\"Northern Ireland is currently without any measures of how our system is performing in both these areas at primary school and Key Stage 3.\"\n\"This is not acceptable and makes us an outlier internationally in being without basic performance data.\"\n\"This new approach is designed to provide a clear, evidence-based understanding of how well our pupils are developing essential knowledge and skills in reading, writing and mathematics and will provide an authoritative picture on our national educational performance.\"\n\"The findings from the assessments will support curriculum development and teacher professional learning.\"\nThe new tests will be created and delivered by the Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) with first taking place in March 2026.",

        "text": "Surrounded by sea and golden sands, Alderney - the most northerly of the Channel Islands - is facing a challenge.\nWith a population of just over 2,000, the island has an ageing demographic which is making some fear for its future.\nThose who live in Alderney said a lack of job opportunities, affordable transport and even things to do was leading to an exodus of young people.\n\"If we can't retain the younger generation, then we'll be in big trouble trying to look after the older generation,\" said charity worker Barbara Benfield.\nMs Benfield, who was born in Alderney and runs the island's Age Concern charity, which was hosting a bingo night when she spoke to the BBC, said: \"It's charities and goodwill that support a lot of the things those elderly people need.\n\"I see every day how many elderly people are here.\"\nAs the game rolled on, she expressed concerns about the rising costs of long-term health benefits and predicted a future of \"serious financial trouble\" unless the burden eased.\nAdding to the financial worries, she said many young people were leaving the island to look for jobs and failing to return when they have their own children.\nShe said more needed to be done to stop the exodus and suggested it should be made easier for young people to buy homes in Alderney.\n\"They are the people that the older generation need, they are the people the island needs,\" she said.\nAccording to the 2023 States of Alderney census, the island has a population of 2,167.\nThe data showed for every 100 people of working age there were 83 \"dependent\" people - meaning they were under 16 or eligible for the pension - an increase from 68 a decade earlier.\nThe 2023 data showed 45% of the population were of dependent age, with 36% of those being of pension age.\nIn England and Wales, the percentage of over 66-year-olds was below 18%, the Office for National Statistics estimated.\nFigures showed only 9% of Alderney residents were under 16 in 2023.\nThose on the front line of caring for an ageing population warned the island needs to \"prepare itself\" for the future.\nLiz Bowskill, who runs Connaught Care, which oversees a residential home in the island and also provides home care services, said: \"I've seen nothing but the needs of the population increase.\n\"The risk is that we're going to have massive gaps in services and potential waiting lists.\"\nDescribing the demographics of the island, she said there was a mix of baby boomers and migrant retirees.\nShe added many did not have familial support, which was \"unusual for a small rock\".\nThe older population was generally healthy, she said, with many able to live in the community well into their 90s.\nHowever, she warned that was not sustainable.\n\"There's only so long you can go stretched on neighbours' support and neighbours' care and input from our organisation,\" she said.\n\"Alderney is beautiful - I can understand why people want to retire here and we should celebrate our older population.\n\"But we need to prepare ourselves for when those individuals need care and make sure we have the right resources and people here.\"\nAcross the road from the care home is 32-year-old filmmaker Cameron Cairnduff, who is working on a video promoting Alderney's only school.\nBorn in the UK but raised in Alderney, before embarking on a marketing career which took him around the world, Mr Cairnduff returned, he said, to find the island had \"started to fall apart\".\nCiting empty shops and businesses due to a lack of young people willing to take over, he said: \"As the demographic gets older, it gets a lot less appealing for young people to be here.\n\"Not only are there less job opportunities, but generally we all want different things.\n\"Maybe the older generation want a quiet life, but young people want things to do.\"\nThe Corder family are also among those feeling the impacts.\nIan Corder, 37, said the availability and cost of travel from the island was a growing headache.\nA return trip to Guernsey via plane, just 10 minutes away, currently costs just short of \u00a3200 and services can be unpredictable.\n\"Even though I'm lucky to be able to work from home, you still want and need to get away,\" Mr Corder said.\n\"There are more blocks to doing that and more expense.\"\nMrs Corder, 33, a veterinarian who has lived in Alderney most of her life, added: \"One of my very best friends has recently left the island with two young children.\n\"They've moved to Guernsey to get the opportunities they need.\"\nEdward Hill, who topped the poll at a recent election to the States, the body that governs Alderney, said radical changes were needed.\n\"I've lost four families in the past two months, with nine children between them,\" he said.\n\"If something isn't done, then we will have a very unbalanced population.\n\"We won't be able to provide services for the older population. We basically won't be able to run the island.\"\nBill Abel, chairman of Alderney States Policy and Finance Committee, said an older population was not necessarily a drain on States funds because many residents had \"their own monies and pensions\".\nHowever, he said the healthcare burden was a \"major challenge\" and the island needed \"younger people to come in\".\nHe said more job opportunities and a reliable transport service - including an upgrade to the runway - would be an \"enabler\".\nRenewable energy could bring employment hope, he added, with discussions ongoing over an offshore wind farm and tidal renewables across the island.\n\"Until we can improve our infrastructure... that's not going to be a positive for attracting people here,\" he said.\nIt is these problems - and possible solutions - that weigh on Mr Cairnduff's mind as he ponders the future of the island.\n\"There's just something about your home and wanting to protect it,\" he said.\n\"I don't know anybody else who comes from a community like this.\n\"I have accepted the fact that if I'm going to be here it's going to be a lot less exciting and quite lonely at times.\"\nIslanders need to embrace new ideas if change is to happen, he argued.\n\"I'm going to stay here until I get a positive signal that this island is heading in the right direction,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

That's better for passengers, better for congestion, and better for our planet.\"\nThere are approximately 13,000 Diamond pass holders in the WECA area, and the authority has previously restricted use of the Diamond passes to after 09:00.\nDiamond pass holder Hetty Pratt has a disability and lives in assisted accommodation with Swallow but needs to catch a bus into Bath at 05:50 every morning for work.\n\"I really want a job so that I can be independent and show people that I can live on my own\" said Hetty.\n\"Without the bus I wouldn't be able to get to work and it costs a lot of money.\"\nMs Sabine said: \"The two young people I met aren't working brilliantly high-paid jobs and the bus pass really makes a huge difference to them,\" said Ms Sabine.\n\"People with disabilities often have that bus pass because they can't drive, and it's there only means to get into employment.\"\n\"As a society it's pretty fair of us to support them getting out into work if they can and they want to.\"\nThe move comes alongside a freeze in the price of child fares, an extension of free travel for care leavers and a cap on multi-operator bus tickets.\nThe DfT provisionally sets the hours that disabled bus passes can be used but local authorities have the ability to change this.\nA spokesperson said that they \"fully recognise bus passes are vital to many\" for access to work, services and keeping people connected.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

        "text": "A foster care programme which provides a network of support is being used by more councils in the West to match children in care with homes.\nThe Mockingbird programme originated in Seattle, in the US. It is being led by The Fostering Network in the UK which said the number of children in care was rising each year.\nMandy Gibbons, from South Gloucestershire, works as a Mockingbird home hub carer and not only fosters herself but supports other foster families in the area.\n\"You know the children are coming somewhere you're happy with, you know the carer so it just works all round,\" she said.\nLatest date from the Fostering Network suggests there were 56,390 children in England living with foster families at the end of March 2024.\nLilian Stephens, head of Mockingbird has explained it is \"an extended family model of foster care\".\n\"It's based on the concept a village to raise a child,\" she said.\nThe centre is a \"hub home\", which provides support to satellite homes, these are in turn supported by a liaison officer and the fostering service.\nThere are 116 councils in the UK using the model. In the West there are partners in South Gloucestershire, Bristol, North Somerset, Wiltshire and Somerset.\nBath and North East Somerset Council are in the process of potentially signing up as well.\nMandy and Adam Gibbons have been fostering children for 16 years.\nShe described it as the \"most incredible, rewarding thing you will do\".\n\"To see how you can change a person's life by giving them time and love they need is like watching a flower open,\" she said.\nLucy Robinson is a senior social worker for South Gloucestershire Council, which is now part of what is called a Mockingbird constellation, or partner.\n\"It is really a structure of support and the way that we deliver it,\" she told the BBC, adding it is based on the premise it takes a village to raise a child.\nMs Robinson added the children being given foster homes tell them they valued being able to speak to other youngsters in the same situation.\nOther organisations helping children in care include Home for Good, which was set up by Christian leaders in 2013 following a national shortage in foster homes across the country.\n\"One girl who came to us when she was just eleven still calls us mum and dad and she's in her twenties,\" said Dave Kingswood from Midsummer Norton in Somerset who works for the organisation.\nPreviously a social worker, Mr Kingswood and his wife and their two children decided to become fosterers 10 years ago.\nHe told BBC Radio Bristol looking back, \"I ask myself what were we doing...but actually it was incredible.\"\nHe added: \"Now my kids are older and they have an empathy that not every kid comes from the same background.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The average cost of college has more than doubled since 2001, the research group found.\nThe financial aid expansions come as the Trump administration has threatened to pull funding from universities over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, research and coursework that they allege is a form of racial discrimination.\nUnder Trump, the Department of Education has said it is investigating 52 universities across the country for alleged \"racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities\" as Trump attempts to get rid of DEI programmes.\nThe Trump administration has already pulled $400m in grants and contracts from Columbia University, alleging the Ivy League school failed to prevent antisemitism on campus as protests grew over Israel's war in Gaza.\nLast year, the US Supreme Court voted to overturn affirmative action. The practice favoured individuals in disadvantaged groups to help eliminate discrimination against marginalised applicants during the enrollment process and increase diversity among students.\nUniversities across the US have reported a decline in racial diversity since the court's decision.",

        "text": "A Saturday school in Northamptonshire aims to teach children about their Polish heritage and language. But many of its pupils - and teachers - have returned to Poland since Brexit. Where does that leave the school and the local Polish community?\nWellingborough Polish School launched in 2006 with just 40 pupils.\nHead teacher Ela Smykla says the aim of the supplementary weekly school is to \"ensure our kids will remember [their heritage] and speak Polish\".\nClasses are held for three hours on Saturday mornings. Pupils learn about Polish language, history, geography and religion, and there is singing and dancing for younger children.\nIt has been run from a number of different schools, and is currently based at Huxlow Academy in Irthlingborough.\nAttendance peaked in 2019, and since then, the school has had about 340 students each year.\nParents are charged \u00a3120 per semester for their first child, and \u00a390 for the second, with any additional child exempt from fees. There are two semesters per year.\nMs Smykla says: \"I am incredibly proud of our school and everything we have accomplished together.\n\"Our staff is truly dedicated, working tirelessly to provide the best possible service to our students.\n\"I take great pride in the size of our school and the trust that parents place in us by sending their children every Saturday.\"\nBut since Brexit, Ms Smykla says \"things have definitely changed\".\n\"We've seen a lot of families and parents leaving, and six out of between 18 and 20 teachers have left,\" she says.\nMs Smykla says this might affect the future of the school.\n\"At some point we may not have students to attend to our school, or we will have to close some classes.\"\nOn 1 May 2004, Poland became one of 10 new European Union member countries.\nMany EU countries anticipated a big movement of people from east to west after expansion, and introduced transitional controls to limit this movement.\nBut the Labour government chose not to introduce these. As a result, migration to Britain from the rest of Europe significantly increased, with most of the extra numbers coming from Eastern Europe.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the Polish-born population of the UK was 743,000 in 2021, up from 579,000 in 2011.\nIn the latest census in 2021, just over 10,200 North Northamptonshire residents said they were born in Poland.\nThis represented 2.8% of the district's population, making Poland the second-most represented country of birth after England.\nThis figure was up from just over 6,000 in 2011.\nIn 2019, Poland's ambassador to the UK wrote to 800,000 Polish nationals, advising them to \"seriously consider\" returning home after Brexit.\nArkady Rzegocki said living standards in Poland were improving, providing \"a very good opportunity to come back\".\nKarolina, chairwoman of the school's parent governors, came to the UK in 2003 as a student.\nHer three daughters, Amelia, Lilly and Vivienne, have either attended or are still at the school.\nShe says she had always wanted to them to be able to communicate with family in Poland, especially their grandparents.\n\"Of course, at home we have Polish TV. We try to talk as much as we can in Polish so they will not lose that confidence to speak, but mainly it was [because] I do want them to recognise they are, somewhere inside, still Polish, and know all the traditions; that school process we went through as young kids.\"\nShe says they did not always want to attend, and there were sometimes \"big dramas\" about going to school on a Saturday, but that it had paid off.\n\"It has benefitted my eldest daughter as the points from her Polish A-level helped her get into university, and my parents and grandparents are happy to be able to communicate with them easily,\" she says.\nPawel moved to the UK in 2005. He met his wife, who is also Polish, in Corby where they live with their son Jan, 13, and daughter Mircelina, eight, who were both born in England.\nIn sending them to the school, Pawel says they had \"basically gifted [Jan] a GCSE for free\" as he could read, write and speak Polish as well as if he had attended school in Poland.\nBut he says sending the children to school on Saturday, after five days of mainstream education, had not always been easy.\n\"It was challenging because our son didn't understand why he had to go to school six days a week,\" he says.\n\"When everybody was having Saturday off, we had to wake up early to travel to Wellingborough.\"\nJustyna Nowak, a GP working in Northampton, moved over in 2006, and lives in Wellingborough with her husband and their five children - two sons and three daughters - aged between three and 13.\nAll attend the Polish school.\nDr Nowak says: \"I think it's important for their identity. Knowing your ancestors; knowing your history is really important, and I didn't want them to get lost.\n\"They are taught how to read and write in Polish and I don't think on my own, especially as a working parent, I'd have been able to teach that.\"\nWrenn School in Wellingborough is a co-educational comprehensive and sixth form with about 1,500 students.\nPrincipal Laura Parker says: \"We've got about 30% of students who have English as an additional language (EAL), and that ranges across all sorts of different languages.\n\"We do something called Diversity Day, where they are able to share their languages and traditions and things that happen in different cultures, so that our students can be really open to all the sorts of different cultures that are going on.\"\nThe school has an EAL team that works with students when needed. Polish is also taught as an option language for students at GCSE and A-level.\nAll schools receive funding for EAL pupils for up to three years from their date of entry to the UK.\nFor the current last financial year (2024-25), secondary schools got \u00a31,585 per pupil per year and primary schools got \u00a3590.\nMrs Parker says most of the school's EAL students will have entered the UK while at primary school, meaning they no longer qualify for the payments.\nBut she says the school uses the funding it does receive to employ EAL assistants and create a \"hub space\" for those who need it.\n\"We have a range of children, from those that have got to the UK and have no English at all, to children that were born in the UK but speak different languages at home,\" she says.\nTheir level of acquisition determines the level of support they receive, she says.\nThose needing the most help are taken out of mainstream classes and taught English.\n\"Sometimes there will be teaching assistants in class where pupils have very low levels of acquisition to help them navigate a classroom and what that's like in a different language,\" she says.\n\"I think it's a really positive thing for students to have such a diverse community.\"\nShe says the number of languages spoken in school does not impact on the school, the pupils or their learning.\n\"They will know if there's people in their class who speak another languages and we really encourage them to talk about the fact that it's a good thing to have multiple languages,\" she says.\nMrs Parker says the school is \"still working\" on communication with parents who might not speak English, and try to translate things such as letters home where they can, but rely on families to tell them if they need that help.\nThe school also sends most things electronically so parents can use online translation services, such as Google Translate, she says.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "text": "The founder of an international photography project set up during the pandemic for women to share their \"authentic representation\" of motherhood is fundraising to protect the collection as part of history.\nKarni Arieli, 50, from Bristol, came up with the idea of the Eye Mama Project in 2020, to counter the unrealistic images she was seeing of motherhood on social media while juggling parenting and working during Covid.\nNow with about 70,000 images taken and sent to her by women from more than 60 countries, Ms Arieli, said the collection helps represent the \"true essence of motherhood, which has remained hidden for too long\".\nShe hopes to raise \u00a335,000 to sustain and archive the project.\nMs Arieli, who was a 2024 BAFTA nominee with her husband Saul Freed for their film Wild Summon, said the project sits on the exact junction she was at in her own life in 2020, as a mother, a photographer and filmmaker.\n\"I never see my reality and the juggle and duality and imperfections and that's what led me to begin this. It's a passion project that ballooned,\" she said.\nThrough the Eye Mama project different journeys are represented through pictures of IVF, miscarriages, birth, fostering and adoption.\n\"Motherhood is a multifaceted experience. It is both a joyous and exhausting journey, one that carries with it moments of profound love, overwhelming frustration, and deep vulnerability,\" she added.\n\"The days after birth can be so intense and crazy and it's not really spoken about. It can be one of the most dangerous moments and it really bonds us as women.\n\"And motherhood is for everyone, not just for mothers, because we're all children,\" and the stories told through the pictures are widely relatable, she said.\nMs Arieli said motherhood can often be unsupported and [can lead] to isolation and feelings of inadequacy and failure, despite its universal significance. And has long been underrepresented in ways that capture its complexity.\n\"So the Eye Mama Project aims to change that by offering a platform where motherhood is shown in all its forms; as self-portraits of mothers navigating their own realities, embracing moments of strength and fragility.\"\nThe images help \"illuminate the work of care and shine a light on the women who perform it through photography, helping to validate their experiences, because feeling seen makes us feel less alone,\" she added.\n\"We need a village, and dads and grandparents are part of this story too, every carer needs support.\"\nOver the last five years, Ms Arieli has managed the work herself and hopes the funding will help continue the project in a more sustainable way in the long term.\n\"Then people can look back at this time and say 'this is what motherhood looks like', which we can't do in other time on history because it doesn't exist.\"\nSaving and preserving the \"unique portfolio of care\", ensures the voices continue to be seen, heard, acknowledged and celebrated for years to come, Ms Arieli said.\n\"To create a first ever motherhood image archive, for the future of us, and care, is empowering the invisible,\" she said.\n\"Because if you see yourself in these images then I think you feel less alone.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "text": "\"Imagine you are a chickpea,\" says the speaker. A hall full of children at John Henry Newman primary school in Oxford are eagerly listening.\n\"Would you rather be in a soup, a salad, or a Noah's pudding?\"\nThis is not a cookery lesson, but a scheme which teaches children about the values of equality, diversity and inclusion.\nThe initiative, called Life of a Chickpea, is now planning to expand after it won a BBC Make a Difference award.\nIt was devised by Mahmut Gunaydin, who leads the Oxford branch of The Dialogue Society, a charity which promotes social cohesion.\nHe was awarded the BBC Radio Oxford Community Award for his work.\nNominations are currently open for the 2025 BBC Make a Difference Awards.\nStacked up to the side of the hall are piles of Noah's puddings.\nThe pudding is a mixture of 10 different ingredients - as well as chickpeas, it includes pomegranates, apples, apricots and barley.\nThe Life of a Chickpea programme uses the pudding as a metaphor for society.\n\"The pudding shows we can be different but come together without losing our shape, our taste, our identity,\" explains Mahmut.\nLife of a Chickpea also tries to reinforce British Values, which have been a core part of the school curriculum since 2014.\nEleven-year-old Jesse is among the pupils listening.\n\"It told us that the Noah's pudding expresses all five British values, because although all the ingredients are different, they bring the best out in each other.\"\nSiddiqa, 10, recounts the story of where the pudding came from.\n\"On Noah's ark, they all got very hungry after surviving the flood, and they just got every food that they had and they put it together to make the Noah's pudding.\"\nMahmut explains that the story is known in a number of religions. \"It's in The Quran, Bible and Torah,\" he says.\nThe session is led by volunteers from The Dialogue Society, but children also get to hear from faith leaders, on this occasion from the Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities.\n\"It was great for the children to see leaders from all different types of faiths,\" teacher Klarisa Dani says.\n\"I think children often view them as separate religions and actually they do all come together and share a similar belief.\"\nMahmut won the BBC Make a Difference Award in September.\n\"After that recognition, our Life of a Chickpea project had more impact in the region,\" he says.\n\"We've had more schools wanting to be involved in the project in Oxford, and we are planning to expand throughout Oxfordshire.\"\nSession over, and Jesse, Siddiqa and their classmates are taking home with them valuable lessons - and the best bit, their Noah's puddings.\nThe Make a Difference Awards recognise people, across eight different categories, who are making a difference where they live.\nEvery BBC Local Radio station will host awards in 2025.\nIt is a chance to say thank you to people who make life better for others.\nNominations can be made via the BBC Make a Difference website where you can also see full terms and the privacy notice.\nNominations close on the 31st March 2025 at 17:00.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.",

        "text": "Children in the South East are still feeling the effects of Covid-19 five years on, school leaders have said.\nIn March 2020, the UK's 24,000 schools were closed for most children at the start of the pandemic, opening and closing multiple times in the months that followed.\nAnne Longfield, who was the children's commissioner for England during this time, told the Covid inquiry that its impact will affect the most vulnerable children for years to come.\nMichelle Catterson, headteacher at the Moon Hall School in Reigate, Surrey, for children with dyslexia, said pupils' \"normality was gone - it was out of the window\".\nMs Catterson said the increase in children having anxiety, school refusal and mental health referrals seen since the pandemic hasn't subsided with time.\nShe attributes this to the long-lasting impact of the pandemic.\n\"Children did not see their friends, their normality was gone - it was out of the window,\" Ms Catterson said.\n\"They didn't see the teachers. That routine, especially for children with special educational needs is really important.\n\"I think that has had a long-term detrimental impact to them.\"\nThe loss of routine is something that children at Edenbridge Primary School in Kent also struggled with.\nHeadteacher Mary Gates said this created learning gaps that \"we're still seeing today\".\nEfforts are being made to redress this, she said.\n\"We recognised that social skills was a really big factor...[and] also speech and language development - particularly for our younger children, so we put a big focus on vocabulary, on speaking and listening opportunities within the curriculum,\" she said.\nThe school is \"almost over teaching certain elements\", she added.\nBoth Ms Catterson and Ms Gates agree that Covid-19 represented an incredibly challenging time.\nMs Catterson said that managing a pandemic \"definitely didn't come up\" in her training, while Ms Gates believes this period was ultimately \"transformative\" for school leaders.\nKent-based educational psychologist Dr Mickel Johnson said the enduring effects were most visible in children in Years One to Four.\nDr Johnson said: \"The impact that we've noticed in our role is definitely the increased awareness of anxiety or difficulties in implementing social behaviours in the playground within the school environment.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, on X and on Instagram.

        "text": "Education Minister Jenny Gilruth has vowed the SNP will \"stand by\" free tuition fees despite the funding crisis facing Scotland's universities.\nScotland is the only UK nation to offer free university tuition to its home students.\nThe future of the policy has been questioned amid a funding crisis in the sector, which was brought into sharp focus last week after Dundee University announced it is to cut 632 jobs in a bid to address a \u00a335m deficit.\nGilruth described its situation as \"deeply concerning\" but added factors such as inflationary pressures and national insurance contributions were having a wider impact on the higher education sector.\nShe told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: \"My party, the SNP, is never going to support a policy where we bring back tuition fees.\n\"We need to look to the progress we have made in relation to widening access to children from our poorer communities.\n\"We have seen real and significant progress in that.\"\nThe Dundee University cuts, announced on Tuesday, represents about 20% of the university's workforce of more than 3,000 people.\nInterim principal Prof Shane O'Neill also confirmed an external investigation would also be conducted into \"what went wrong.\"\nElsewhere, the University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months, Aberdeen University has cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes and the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\".\nIt has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.\nGilruth said Dundee's situation was \"troubling\" for staff and students alike.\nAnd she confirmed the Scottish government had pledged an additional \u00a310m to the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) to supplement the \u00a315m that was put in place through the Scottish Budget.\nLast week the University and College Union said Dundee staff were being made to pay the price for \"egregious management failure\".\nGilruth also highlighted wider pressures, such as the rise in national insurance contributions announced by the Chancellor last October, which Universities Scotland say will cost institutions \u00a345m.\nAsked why the taxpayer should pay for students from wealthy families to attend university, the minister said: \"Our policy on free tuition is well understood by the Scottish people and we don't go back on our promises in relation to this.\n\"We have been very clear on our policy position on this over a number of years.\n\"Free tuition is a policy we will stand by.\"\nPressed on whether it would be in the SNP's Holyrood election manifesto next year, she replied: \"Absolutely.\"\nMeanwhile, opposition politicians later criticised the minister's comments.\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said Gilruth's lack of accountability was \"staggering\" given the scale of cuts facing the sector.\nHe added: \"Her shameful attempt to compare the dire state of university finances in Scotland with elsewhere in the UK highlights the SNP's unwillingness to face this issue head-on.\n\"The SNP's savage cuts have led to the dreadful position that our universities find themselves in, with many now having a question mark over their financial outlook and even their survival.\"\nLiberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said there were \"serious problems\" at most universities and the sector as a whole faced \"strong headwinds\".\nHe added: \"Universities are changing with more part time students, the recruitment of international students is volatile and the there are higher taxes like employers national insurance contributions.\n\"If all that is changing we need to hunt for a new financial model.\"",

        "text": "Free school meals in Wales should be \"more cost effective, healthier, and more climate friendly\", a leading academic has said.\nProf Kevin Morgan, from Cardiff University's school of geography, also said Wales was a \"long way off\" being able to source entirely local food in schools.\nAll primary school children are eligible for free school meals in Wales. Families of older children can also apply for free school meals, with eligibility based on household income.\nThe Welsh government said it was working closely with councils to offer \"the best possible food in schools\".\nProf Morgan, who has previously written a book about food in schools, hospitals and prisons, said the quality of meals being provided in Wales needed to be raised.\n\"We are the first and only UK nation to have implemented free school meals in all primary schools. Wales has won international plaudits for doing so \u2013 but we need to raise the quality of that food,\" he told Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\n\"There is no good universalising poor quality food.\"\nProf Morgan also expressed concern about the ability to source \"local food\".\n\"If we wanted to source entirely local food in schools tomorrow, it couldn't be done, not least because our horticulture sector in Wales is so under-developed,\" he added.\n\"That is one of the great opportunities before us now, as we are boosting the demand side of things.\n\"You need to use that power of purchase, procurement budgets, to build up that source of supply.\"\nProf Morgan was speaking almost a decade since the creation of the Future Generations Act, which placed a legal duty on public bodies to take the needs of future generations into account.\nIt was introduced by the then-National Assembly for Wales in April 2015 and hailed as ground-breaking by the United Nations.\n\"Free school meals... is the best example of a tangible expression of the Future Generations Act,\" said Prof Morgan.\nHe said he believed it was a \"wonderful and laudable piece of legislation\", but said it suffered from \"everything that devolution has suffered from in Wales\" which he called \"the gap between aspiration and delivery\".\n\"We are asking local authorities and public bodies to step up to this enormous challenge, after almost twenty years of austerity budgets, where their capacity has been hollowed out,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We want the best school food offer in the UK to give our children the healthiest start to life. Our roll out of free school meals for all primary school learners means every child is offered a nutritious meal.\n\"We are working closely with our local authorities to offer the best possible food in schools.

Birmingham has the second largest number of schools in the programme with 24.\nSchools will receive a lump sum for set up and a further amount for costs, including staffing. They will also receive a varying amount per pupil.\nLotty Summers, a librarian from Bloxwich, said she wouldn't be able to get to work without the breakfast club.\n\"It really helps with work-life balance. It's so exciting, we already get the extra help with tax-free childcare, and having even more help with this is amazing for us.\"\nParent Andy Hunt said he signed up his two daughters \"straight away\" when he found out about the initiative.\n\"It will make our lives a lot easier in the morning because it is one less thing to stress about.\n\"It gives the kids the ability to have a hearty breakfast before school and means we will be able to get work on time, which is a massive help for us.\"\nSome MPs and headteachers have expressed concern that, at 60p per pupil per day, funding is too low. However, schools in deprived areas can get an uplift.\nLeader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch, took the government to task during Prime Minister's Questions, describing \"60p breakfast clubs\".\nThe Prime Minister said Ms Badenoch \"should be welcoming them\".\nBecky Bailey, head teacher at Rivers, said she was \"thrilled\" her school is in the pilot, and confirmed 90 families have already expressed an interest.\nShe added: \"Any head teacher who has agreed to be part of this pilot understands that there are going to be logistical challenges, but that is why we are embracing it so we can shape the project.\"\nShenstone Lodge School, 10 miles away in Lichfield, is also involved in the pilot.\nAs a special school, it will receive \u00a33.23p per pupil.\nCurrently, the school offers children toast, milkshakes and apple juice when they arrive from their taxis.\nHead teacher Ian Mitchell said, the initiative is a challenge \"on a couple of levels\" \u2013 including rearranging the taxis which bring the majority of children to school.\nMr Mitchell also said he needs to consider the staffing of the clubs.\n\"Overwhelmingly, we are excited about the project and determined to try to make it work\", he added.\nYear 5 Teacher Emma Stretton said it will also ease the strain on their pockets.\n\"At least half of the teachers here subsidise the breakfast because it isn't enough\", she said.\n\"It is a godsend and it'll make a massive difference.\"\nThe government plans to roll breakfast clubs out to all schools in England.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X, and Instagram",

        "text": "Parents and guardians who have suffered violence at the hands of children in their care say support services are a \"postcode lottery\". Despite a seeming rise in attacks, alongside greater awareness, experts agree the problem is not being properly addressed.\nHere, one couple share their experience.\n\"She had me round the throat one day,\" Angela, a guardian to a young girl, told the BBC.\n\"Another time she had me against the bench with a knife at at her throat, saying she was going to kill herself and make me watch.\n\"That was a really, really scary time that seemed to go on forever.\"\nAfter a family breakdown, Chris and Angela (not their real names) took on the care of a female relative who was still at primary school.\nOver time, they say, the child's behaviour deteriorated until the couple realised they were in physical danger.\nThey were open with social services from the outset, but say their concerns were \"minimised\" and they were just told to \"keep going.\"\n\"What do we do when she's smashing the house up or when she's got me locked in a room?\"\n\"Things were escalating beyond what was safe,\" recalls Chris.\n\"I felt pathetic, because why should I have to call the police to protect us from an 11-year-old or a 13-year old? It's humiliating.\"\nChris and Angela say they eventually had no choice but to call the police, but attending officers made it plain the child would not be taken out of the situation, nor would charges be brought.\nExperts say child-to-parent violence and abuse (sometimes known as CAPVA, CPA or APVA) can be sparked by childhood trauma or a youngster witnessing domestic abuse in the home.\nIt can also be more common in families with neurodiverse children.\nBecause there is no standard definition for this type of domestic violence, offences are recorded in different ways across the country meaning it can be difficult to measure the scale of the problem.\nWe asked 39 police forces in England for the number of reported crimes involving adolescent or child on parent violence and abuse in their areas in 2015, 2019 and 2023.\nOf the 17 forces which responded, 10 recorded more cases in 2023 than in 2019.\nIn north-east England, where Chris and Angela live, North Yorkshire, Northumbria and Durham police did not provide figures, but both Cumbria Constabulary and Cleveland Police reported an increase in cases.\nOne former social worker - who wishes to remain anonymous - told the BBC she witnessed violence against parents first hand, sometimes from children as young as eight.\nShe believes that, although the subject is now more openly discussed, services offered by some local authorities have yet to catch up with the level of risk some children present.\n\"These parents are dealing with this on a daily basis,\" she says.\n\"I think things like social media, trying to manage the use of mobile phones, that's becoming a real trigger point when they're trying to put parental controls in place, because children don't want that and they're acting out.\n\"I've been in households where I've seen significant levels of harm directed towards parents and carers from children and, even with professional intervention to try to de-escalate, it has resulted in police call outs.\"\nChris and Angela felt social services encouraged them to offer their child \"leeway\" rather than making it clear her behaviour was unacceptable.\n\"We'd tell them 'look, we don't think we can go on with this',\" says Chris. \"We don't think this is good for us or her.\n\"They would just blow smoke up (our backsides) about what a good job we're doing. We felt hopeless.\"\nAngla adds: \"Now she just thinks this is what people do.\n\"When you're in an abusive relationship, you have the option to go. But when it's your kids you don't, do you?\"\nCAPVA researcher Dr Nikki Rutter believes early intervention is key for carers like Chris and Angela.\n\"Local authorities here in the North East are very good at responding to families where there are very particular high risk needs,\" she says.\nDr Rutter points to what she sees as exemplary areas of practice in certain areas of the country, including Wales and Norfolk, but says problems lie in the systems that should refer families for help when they first have issues.\n\"Early intervention is very, very rarely occurring in any of the local authorities throughout the North.\n\"They're dealing with the problem rather than preventing it in the first place.\n\"Sometimes it can be services saying 'this isn't our responsibility', 'we're not commissioned to do this' or 'we are restricted in terms of staffing'.\n\"For those families it must just feel like there's no way out or there's not many people listening.\n\"Families are crying out for help, quite often from the child being four to five years old, and nothing is being done.\"\nThe government has pledged to halve violence against women and girls in the next ten years.\nIt says tackling abuse of parents in their own homes is a \"vital\" part of that challenge.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to develop our specific approach to child-to-parent abuse, taking on board the contributions to last year's consultation.\n\"We will set out our plans in this area and respond formally to the consultation in the coming months.\"\nIn County Durham, the police and county council have started jointly funding \"ambassadors\" to run a \"Respect\" programme with families that need help.\nYoung people and parents have their own workers who then come together over time to make changes.\nJackie Staff, one of the support workers, says violence towards parents and guardians is only just really starting to be discussed more openly, but things are changing as a result.\n\"We're getting some real successes from the families,\" Ms Staff says.\n\"They're telling us that it is working and the behaviour has reduced.\"\nBut Joy Allen, Durham's Police and Crime Commissioner, says a lot of parents are still suffering in silence.\n\"One in 10 women who've been murdered by a man have been murdered by their son,\" she says.\n\"That's a significant fact that we need to address and early intervention is much better than escalating.\n\"We want people to have the confidence to come to us for support. It isn't anything to be ashamed of and there is help out there.\"\nAngela and Chris are clear about what they think needs to change.\n\"Definitely funding for children's mental health I think is a massive thing, but also child-to-adult violence is not talked about,\" says Angela.\n\"Parents are embarrassed. We were embarrassed.\n\"We didn't want to tell anyone that this child has been violent. I think that's a massive issue.\"\nChris says he feels seeking support somewhere you can be honest about exactly what is happening is essential.\n\"Even if it's Facebook groups, it's people going through the same thing,\" he says.\n\"Let's stop pretending that this is not happening, that children aren't being physically violent towards the parents.\n\"It takes the adults to do that, because the kids are never going to admit it.\"",

        "text": "The end of an Irish-language scheme for English-medium schools is devastating, a school principal has told BBC News NI.\nSt Bronagh's Primary School in Rostrevor is one of more than 80 in Northern Ireland which takes part in the Scoil Spreagtha scheme.\nOrganised by the language organisation Gael Linn, Scoil Spreagtha supports English-medium schools to teach Irish.\nAbout 15,000 pupils in 82 primary schools were involved in the scheme and 80 schools were on the waiting list for it.\nBut Gael Linn has said the funding is not in place to continue the scheme after the end of this school year in June 2025.\nThe all-Ireland Irish language body Foras na Gaeilge recently said it had to make savings of more than \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3669,000) and that would mean funding cuts to some groups operating in Northern Ireland.\nA number of language organisations subsequently staged a half-day strike in protest at the cuts.\nThe principal of St Bronagh's Primary School Jody Mussen said the Scoil Spreagtha scheme allowed non Irish speaking teachers to help pupils with Irish.\n\"The big benefits that we have seen from that are increases in self-confidence and self-awareness,\" he said.\n\"It's raising the profile of language in our school and we very much see the Scoil Spreagtha scheme as a gateway to allowing our kids to access new language and encourage the use of other languages.\n\"They're using other languages and coming in to showcase the bits of French or Spanish or German or Mandarin that they're learning.\"\nMr Mussen said the scheme had been really beneficial to the school.\n\"It's devastating that all the hard work that went into the Scoil Spreagtha scheme and the promotion of the Irish language could potentially be pulled.\"\nA previous scheme to teach languages in primary schools was axed in 2015 due to Department of Education cuts at the time.\nS\u00e9amas Mac Eochaidh, from Gael Linn, said Scoil Spreagtha had been funded for two years as a pilot scheme.\n\"Now, with the fact that there are wider Irish language cuts we do not have the opportunity to roll the scheme out again and develop the pilot we have done,\" he said.\n\"So obviously the indirect impact that the wider Irish language cuts have had on this scheme means that we're not able to develop it.\"\nMr Mac Eochaidh said the schools who took part wanted to encourage their pupils to develop a second language while at primary school.\n\"The manner than we do this is very much positive and creative in what we do, and the schools and teachers are more than welcoming to the work,\" he said.\n\"But the opportunity won't be there if this scheme does not exist.\n\"The majority of these schools are completely dependent on the scheme.\"\nGael Linn had been offering the scheme without ever having a full-time staff member to run it and that has become unsustainable given the interest in it.\n\"Because this is Irish language based, it is in the education sector but people tend to think it's passion over profession,\" Mr Mac Eochaidh said.\n\"It's not just about a passion.\"\n\"In order for this scheme to develop and reach the demand that's there we need to have human resources behind the scheme.\"\nMr Mac Eochaidh said schools had been \"distraught\" over the news that the scheme was due to end, but he hoped that more funding could be found.\n\"We're ready to roll this out as a three-year, five-year, seven-year project,\" he said.\n\"It's just a matter of the funding being made available.\n\"We know what we're doing with these types of schemes, we just need the support to do so.\"\nP\u00f3l Deeds, deputy chief executive of Foras na Gaeilge, said the Scoil Spreagtha scheme had been hugely successful.\n\"But Gael Linn can't continue to carry the responsibility for this rapidly growing project without proper staffing and resources,\" he said.\nMr Deeds said they were \"working with both governments to find a solution to this\".\nHe added: \"We met MLAs from Stormont's education committee and we've been putting together a case for Gael Linn to be properly funded to deliver Scoil Spreagtha.\n\"The Department of Education, I think, needs to take this on as one of their strategic priorities because it is so effective.\n\"It is delivering on things like helping to address educational attainment and encouraging the use of languages.\"",

        "text": "When my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.\nIt was just a quick trip, a temporary break - nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.\nOne month in, she dropped the bombshell - I was not coming back to London until I had reformed and had earned enough GCSEs to continue my education.\nI was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.\nIn their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London\".\nBack in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns.\nI had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd) - and heading down a dangerous path.\nMy closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them.\nBut being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence.\nI can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is \"living in hell\".\nYet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing.\nUnlike the boy at the centre of the London court case - which he lost - I did not go to boarding school in Ghana.\nMy mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.\nI first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.\nThe lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence - even if I was using it recklessly.\nIn Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncle's often muddy pick-up truck and my aunt's car.\nIt was her vehicle that I would later steal - something of a watershed moment.\nI did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldier's Mercedes.\nI tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past.\nThat was the last truly reckless thing I did.\nIt was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana - it was perspective.\nLife in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted.\nWashing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed.\nFood, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs.\nMaking the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar.\nAt the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience.\nInitially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College.\nBut they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief.\nInstead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups.\nLessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience.\nBack home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mother's Fante language - but was far from fluent.\nWhen I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo - an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.\nIn contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghana's education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting.\nI was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science.\nThe rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London.\nThe result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above - something that once seemed impossible.\nBeyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life.\nRespect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them.\nGhana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful - it made me fearless.\nFootball played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string.\nIt was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined - and it is no wonder some of the greatest footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa.\nThe aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill - it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on.\nEvery Sunday, I played football on the beach - though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church.\nThose services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life.\nThe first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline.\nI even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape.\nMy only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home.\nI know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London.\nMichael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as \"bittersweet\". He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer.\nHis main complaint was the loneliness - he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood.\nThis largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London.\n\"I didn't understand Ga. I didn't understand Twi. I didn't understand Pidgin,\" the 49-year-old tells me.\nThis made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years - and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign.\n\"Anywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else,\" he says.\nBut he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: \"It made me a man.\n\"My Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history.\"\nI can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs.\nI developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance - each dish had its own story.\nI became obsessed with \"waakye\" - a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce \"shito\", boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food.\nI enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just \"stuck\" in Ghana any more - I was thriving.\nMy mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago.\nShe saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high.\nI went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme.\nThe guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did.\nGhana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man.\nWhile such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England.\nAnd for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me.\nMark Wilberforce is a freelance journalist based in London and Accra.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Other institutions didn't put all their eggs in one basket.\"\nShe said the union remained in consultation with the university but industrial action was being considered.\nThe university said it was with \"significant disappointment that we have learned of UCU's intention to hold a protest rally deliberately targeting prospective students\".\nA spokesperson sad that it respected the right to legitimate protest but was concerned this was \"an extraordinary act of self-harm by the union given the clear link between student numbers, revenue and our ability to protect employment\".\nThe university was not \"firing and rehiring\", but creating new roles focused on teaching and student contact, without the expectations of research and innovation that come with traditional academic lecturer roles, he added.\nHe said student numbers and jobs had grown, but the student-staff ratio had to be rebalanced.\nThe sector was facing numerous challenges relating to Brexit, UK tuition fees, pension contributions and policies on international students, the spokesperson explained.\nBut he added: \"We have never posted a deficit of \u00a3100m.\"\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
